People will be ordered to stay at home from 0001 GMT on Thursday to combat a surge in new infections that could, if unchecked, cause more deaths than a first wave which forced a three-month lockdown earlier this year.

The 516-38 vote had been in little doubt after the opposition Labour Party said they would support the move, even though they criticised Johnson for acting too slowly. He was also criticised by some in his own party who said a national lockdown was too severe. “None of us came into politics to tell people once again to shutter their shops, to furlough their staff or stay away from their friends and family,” Johnson told parliament in an attempt to calm rebels within his Conservative Party.

The United Kingdom, which has the biggest official death toll in Europe from COVID-19, is grappling with more than 20,000 new coronavirus cases a day and scientists have warned the “worst case” scenario of 80,000 dead could be exceeded.

Those warnings forced Johnson to announce a U-turn on Saturday, having previously insisted on an approach of regional lockdowns.Labour leader Keir Starmer said: “While these regulations are not in any way desirable or perfect, they are now necessary because the government has lost control of the virus.”

Some in Johnson’s own party, however, voted against the plan.

“I have a fundamental problem with much of what we’re being asked to do here - as well as the economic impact, the human toll which this will have,” said Graham Brady, head of an influential Conservative committee.",2020-11-04T18:52:28.118Z,2020-11-04T18:52:28.120Z,

Safety services are reporting an overall increase of activity in the region and increasing their warnings over potential additional activity during the remainder of the year.

Dryad Global is reporting that the 10,000 dwt product tanker Nafeli II, operated by the World Carrier Corp. of Greece, was boarded off the coast of Nigeria, approximately 94 nautical miles southwest of the port of Brass. The Panama-flagged tanker built in 2003, operates with a crew of up to 23 people.

The vessel activated her SSAS emergency alert system and the crew consisting of Georgian, Russian, and Ukrainian seafarers reportedly retreated to the safe area. The boarders left the vessel and the crew was later reported safe.

While the crew was unharmed, Dryad reports that it was the fourteenth such incident in the area this year. The total number of vessels illegally boarded in 2020 in the area of West Africa has now reached 58, which, according to Dryad is tracking slightly above trend when compared to 2019.

Dryad is also cautioning that the rate of incidents increases at the end of the monsoon season in the region. They are warning of a historical trend toward a sharp increase in activity during the later part of the year.

Reviewing the total number of incidents during the first nine months of the year, a report issued by the ICC International Maritime Bureau (IMB) also highlighted a dramatic increase of activity off West Africa. According to the IMB’s data, there was a 40 percent increase in the number of kidnappings reported in the Gulf of Guinea, compared with the same period in 2019. Pirates armed with guns and knives they warned are abducting bigger groups of seafarers at further distances off the West African coast.",2020-11-05T11:01:19.027Z,2020-11-05T11:01:19.041Z,

The other bidders were a consortium of Grimaldi Euromed and Minoan Lines, Danthia Shipping, MRG Ltd, Portek International, Quintana Infrastructure and Thessaloniki Port Authority , the agency said.

The deadline for bidding expired at 1500 GMT on Friday.

Greece embarked on an ambitious privatization plan in 2010, at the start of a decade-long financial crisis, to help reduce its public debt and attract investors to overhaul and boost the business efficiency of its assets.

This was unveiled during the SRS Forum 2020, a virtual forum organised by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) on 3 November. The theme of this year’s forum was ”Resilience, Strength and Adaptability”.

Speaking at the opening address, Quah Ley Hoon, Chief Executive of MPA, said:

“While the pandemic has thrown Maritime Singapore many challenges, it also presented us with opportunities to emerge stronger.”

“To do this, MPA will strengthen partnerships to drive digitalisation and decarbonisation of shipping and ensure that the Singapore Registry of Ships is adaptable and agile in the new normal. MPA will also continue supporting our seafarers, the backbone of the maritime industry, through the pandemic.”

As explained, the maritime sector including the Port of Singapore has remained resilient even with COVID-19. Singapore’s container throughput registered a 3.7% growth in September this year compared to the same month last year.

In addition, Singapore’s bunkering volumes were also 5.6% higher from January to September this year, compared to the same period last year.

Port of Singapore facilitates crew change for more than 50,000 seafarers
While fighting the pandemic, MPA has focused on building resilience to support seafarers during the coronavirus.

During this pandemic, seafarers face crew change restrictions due to border control measures. Since 27 March 2020, MPA has facilitated crew change in Singapore for more than 50,000 sign-on and sign-off crew of all nationalities from ships of different flags involving more than 2,900 companies and 3,500 ships, through a set of ‘safe corridor’ procedures.

The procedures are said to minimise risk to public health for the local community, ships and crew involved. 

“Depending on the COVID-19 situation, MPA expects to conduct some 500 to 600 crew changes per day in the coming months,” MPA said.

“For Singapore-flagged ships, 99% of crew onboard are employed within their service contract period. MPA will continue to work closely with ship operators to repatriate the remaining 1% of crew who are still working onboard on extended contracts.”

Adoption of technology
COVID-19 has also accelerated the adoption of technology at the Port of Singapore.

To minimise the risk to crews and surveyors on ships, MPA has been carrying out remote inspections since June this year.

To date, MPA’s surveyors have conducted 128 remote Flag State and Port State inspections involving 74 companies. 

MPA also collaborated with Recognised Organisations to conduct surveys and audits using remote technologies. This includes the inspection of ship equipment via video streaming platforms, and verification of documents sent electronically. Additionally, MPA has carried out close to 250 oral examinations for Certificate of Competency deck and engine candidates through video conferencing since April. 

Decarbonisation efforts
According to MPA, the pandemic has also demonstrated shipping’s importance as a reliable, efficient and cost-effective method of transporting goods.

Partnering with the industry to drive decarbonisation efforts, MPA said it will extend its memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Global Compact Network Singapore, the local chapter of the United Nations Global Compact, by an additional three years to 2023.

This is to promote carbon management and awareness amongst maritime companies. The MoU was first signed in 2017 to provide companies with training on sustainability reporting. 

MPA also presented Green Ship certificates to 15 companies under the Green Ship Programme (GSP) for reducing the environmental impact of their fleet. Since the GSP’s inception in 2011, 597 Singapore-flagged ships have joined the programme. ",2020-11-05T11:04:12.621Z,2020-11-05T11:04:12.637Z,

figure
​​The agreement for the US$2.5 million training programme was signed (on 27 October) by IMO Secretary-General Mr. Kitack Lim and the Minister of Oceans and Fisheries of the Republic of Korea Dr. Seong-Hyeok Moon.​

The Republic of Korea and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have signed an agreement to establish a training programme to support developing States to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping. This will facilitate the implementation of candidate measures to be adopted  by IMO and the development of national action plans to reduce GHG emissions from the shipping and ports sectors.

The Sustainable Maritime Transport Training Programme (GHG-SMART) will focus on Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). It will help them to develop their capacity to achieve the goals set out in the Initial IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships. The IMO strategy envisages reducing total annual GHG emissions from ships by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008, meaning a reduction in carbon intensity for individual ships and a move to new technologies and low/zero carbon fuels. A number of specific measures are under consideration to achieve the ambitious targets.

The strategy recognizes that there are potential barriers to achieving the targets and highlights the need for supportive measures, including capacity building, technical cooperation, technology transfer and research and development (R&D), particularly in developing countries. 

The four-year GHG-SMART programme will, therefore, support States (specifically, SIDS and LDCs) to address gaps in technologies and policies, by building knowledge and capacity in those countries to identify ways to effectively implement measures contained in the IMO Strategy. This would be complemented by support and training to develop and implement National Action Plans. It is widely recognized that national action plans may facilitate the implementation of IMO-adopted measures in the national context and support the achievement of international commitments through national action.

The agreement for the US$2.5 million training programme was signed (on 27 October) by IMO Secretary-General Mr. Kitack Lim and the Minister of Oceans and Fisheries of the Republic of Korea Dr. Seong-Hyeok Moon.

Thanking the Government of the Republic of Korea for their generous funding for the programme, Mr. Lim said, ""If we are to achieve the goals in the initial IMO strategy, then we must ensure that no country is left behind in the transition to carbon-neutral shipping. IMO continues to lead the way with the portfolio of continuously expanding technical cooperation and capacity building projects. This training Programme will greatly enhance the implementation of the Initial IMO GHG Strategy, especially when it comes to building knowledge and capacity  in SIDS and LDCs.""

Dr. Moon said, ""The Republic of Korea is fully supportive of the Initial IMO Strategy on reduction of GHG emissions from ships and the emphasis on its ""Voyage Together"" approach. The Government of the Republic of Korea hopes that this GHG SMART Training Programme will be the beginning of a concerted effort to assist the SIDS and LDCs with the implementation of the IMO Strategy.""

GHG-SMART training and capacity building

Training packages will be developed to cover a range of activities, including analysis and review of current policies, update on IMO regulations, how to develop national action plans, training of trainers to implement specific measures such as data collection, sharing of information and best practices.

It is envisaged that participants will come from a range of different stakeholders, including policy makers, public authorities and industry (shipping, ports and ship building).

The training will also facilitate transfer and uptake of energy efficient technologies, filling gaps in technology and policies between developed countries and the LDCs and SIDS.

Link with other IMO-executed GHG emission reduction projects

The Programme will be strategically linked to the ongoing and proposed major projects implemented by IMO to achieve GHG emissions reduction. These include the Global MTTC Network (GMN) project, funded by the European Union, which unites Maritime Technologies Cooperation Centres (MTCCs) in targeted regions into a global network; and the GreenVoyage2050 Project , a partnership project between the Government of Norway and IMO, which is working with 12 pilot countries in different regions to meet climate change and energy efficiency goals related to international shipping. There will also be cooperation with the World Maritime University (WMU) for technical input, and IMO's Integrated Technical Cooperation Programme (ITCP).

Funding 

This four-year programme will be funded through an allocation of US$2.5 million under the existing Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between IMO and the Republic of Korea on the Republic of Korea's contribution to the Delivering Strategy and Reform – Voyage Together Trust Fund (DSR-VT TF).",2020-11-05T11:13:53.408Z,2020-11-05T11:13:53.412Z,
11,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/04/protests-votes-ballot-counting-us-election,'Count every vote': protesters take to streets across US as ballots tallied Large events organized by progressive groups while Trump supporters gather at vote-counting centers in Phoenix and Detroit,"Protestors marched and rallied across the US on Wednesday as the presidential election remained too close to call. Most demonstrations were large, peaceful events organized by progressive groups calling on officials to “count every vote”. But in some cities, including Phoenix and Detroit, Trump supporters converged on vote-counting centers.

In New York City, thousands marched past boarded-up luxury stores on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue, as ballots were still being tallied in key battleground states.

Similar protests took place in at least a half-dozen cities, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis and San Diego. Demonstrators gathered outside Dallas City Hall in Texas, and in Chicago, protesters demanding a complete count marched through downtown and along a street across the river from Trump Tower.

Many of these events were organized by local groups affiliated with Protect the Results, a coalition of grassroots organizations and labor unions.

In Phoenix a group of pro-Trump protesters, some of them armed, gathered outside the Maricopa county election center, where sheriff’s deputies were guarding both the outside of the building and the counting inside.

Many wore “Make America great again” hats and some carried signs baselessly alleging fraud. The Associated Press and other news organizations, including the conservative network Fox News, declared Biden the victor in Arizona yesterday, but Trump has been inching closer to a tie. Demonstrators chanted: “Shame on Fox.”
Despite reports that counting would be halted as a result of the demonstration, county officials confirmed that ballots would continue to be tallied into the night. Reporters, however, were asked to leave as the pro-Trump protesters crowded outside.
The incident echoed an earlier event in Michigan, when a rightwing, anti-lockdown group crowded outside a ballot-counting site in Detroit. The small cluster of Trump supporters descended on the center amid chants of “Stop the count!”. (In Phoenix, where Biden’s lead was shrinking, Trump supporters shouted the opposite.)
Police made some arrests at the various demonstrations, including 50 in New York. Dozens of protesters were also arrested in Minneapolis after demanding action on a range of issues including policing, climate change and immigration, according to local media reports.

In Portland police declared riots, arrested 11 people and seized fireworks, hammers and a rifle, as Oregon Governor Kate Brown activated the National Guard. “All of the gatherings that were declared riots were downtown,” a Portland Police spokesman told Reuters in an emailed statement. “There have been 11 arrests tonight and we have not received any reports of injuries.”
The demonstrations came as Donald Trump threatened to sue his way to the presidency, launching lawsuits on Wednesday to halt vote-counting in three battleground states. It is not clear that the challenges will alter the election result.

Trump has repeatedly, falsely insisted without evidence that there are major problems with the vote count – and demanded that states that he is in danger of losing stop counting ballots.
Earlier, the Republican campaign filed suit in a bid to halt the count in Michigan, demanding the Democratic secretary of state allow in more inspectors.
The secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, said the “stop the count” protesters outside the counting center in Detroit were a distraction and warned that people would need to “push back against the misinformation that we believe will escalate potentially in the days ahead”.

“As for the folks who showed up in the late hours outside to cause a lot of distraction and make a lot of noise, if they thought they were going to intimidate or stop anyone from doing their job inside the TCF Center, they don’t know Detroit,” Benson said.

Benson defended the ballot-counting as “transparent” and said the Trump campaign’s lawsuit against Michigan, alleging that the campaign had “not been provided with meaningful access to numerous counting locations”, was “frivolous”.

The prolonged task of counting this year’s deluge of mail-in votes had raised fears of widespread civil unrest, but so far that scenario has not come to pass.

On Tuesday night, scattered protests broke out after voting ended, stretching from Washington DC to Seattle, but there was no significant violence.",2020-11-05T11:23:07.931Z,2020-11-05T11:23:07.936Z,
12,https://www.wsj.com/articles/fake-twitter-accounts-posing-as-news-organizations-prematurely-declare-election-victories-11604541638,Fake Twitter Accounts Posing as News Organizations Prematurely Declare Election Victories,"Several Twitter accounts posed as U.S. news organizations on Wednesday to falsely and prematurely declare election victories for Democrat Joe Biden, in what appeared to be a coordinated campaign to inject disinformation into online conversation about the presidential contest.

Twitter quickly suspended the accounts, which mimicked the logos and account names of the Associated Press and, in at least one instance, CNN, both news organizations that independently call U.S. election results. Most of the tweets identified by The Wall Street Journal sought to prematurely announce various victories for Mr. Biden, but in at least one instance, one of the accounts declared President Trump had won re-election.

Trump and Biden’s Paths to Victory

In an initial wave of tweets Wednesday afternoon, three accounts mimicking the AP declared in identical language that Mr. Biden had won the state of Michigan, a few hours before the real AP made the call. A fourth account made the same premature claim for Georgia. The accounts were first identified and linked together publicly by the Journal.

The tweets were retweeted dozens of times and amplified by at least a handful of journalists and other verified Twitter users. Later in the day, multiple organizations did call Michigan for Mr. Biden.

Some of the roughly dozen accounts reviewed by the Journal that shared the false information used the same photos and similar profile names, with minor variations, and in some cases tweeted information in rapid succession, indicating the activity was coordinated across accounts. Other accounts on Twitter quickly posted nearly identical messages and may not have been associated with the disinformation campaign.

The accounts were suspended by Twitter for violating the company’s policy against impersonation, a spokeswoman said.

“These were bogus accounts not affiliated with AP,” Patrick Maks, an AP spokesman, said in an email. “AP’s race calls will be tweeted from @AP and @AP_Politics.”

Later on Wednesday, a separate and far larger tranche of accounts falsely claimed that Mr. Biden had won the presidency and, in one instance, that Mr. Trump had prevailed in his re-election bid. At least one of the tweets was retweeted hundreds of times. Twitter continued to take down most of the accounts quickly, often within minutes of the tweets first appearing. In all cases, the accounts used the hashtag being deployed by the authentic Twitter accounts used by AP to call races, #APracecall.

Another two accounts posing as the AP claimed falsely that an earlier declaration that Mr. Biden had won the battleground state of Wisconsin had been retracted, with one of them falsely asserting the decision had been made because “300,000 new ballots have been found.” In others, fake accounts said Mr. Biden had won Pennsylvania and Georgia, both of which remained too close to call on Wednesday night.

Through a YouTube page listed in the biography of one of the Twitter accounts that pushed out premature information about Michigan, the Journal determined that one of the accounts belonged to Femi Fadiya, a 17-year-old student who lives in London. Contacted by a reporter Wednesday, Mr. Fadiya said that he discovered earlier in the day that his Twitter account name and profile image had been changed to “AP_politics.” He couldn’t log in and, suspecting he had been hacked, he saw the account was suspended.

“I’m confused,” he said in an interview. He said he doesn’t know how the apparent hack happened. “I’ve never experienced it before. It’s a bit weird. I don’t live in the U.S. so I don’t know why I’m associated with an account about the U.S. election.”

In some cases, the accounts appeared to have existed for months or longer, but under different screen names. At some point, several of them changed their names to closely resemble AP accounts, but with subtle differences, such as using a capital “I” to replace a lowercase “i” in the name “APPolitics.”

Senior U.S. intelligence and election security officials have warned for months that malicious actors, including the governments of Russia and Iran, are working to interfere in the election and aiming to sow doubt in the democratic process. The current uncertainty about the election results yielded a fertile environment for disinformation campaigns, officials and experts said.

“We’re in the last leg of the race here, but it’s still a very volatile environment, especially given the disagreements over the outcome,” said John Hultquist, director of intelligence analysis at the U.S.-based cybersecurity company FireEye, which was examining the fake AP account campaign. Twitter has so far done well in quickly and proactively removing the accounts, Mr. Hultquist said, adding that continued vigilance would be important in the days ahead.

The early batch of tweets claiming a premature victory for Mr. Biden in Michigan prompted federal officials to reiterate earlier calls for voters to be patient and not be duped by accounts seeking to amplify disinformation about the election.

“We’re seeing reports of fake media accounts calling a state - don’t fall for it!” Chris Krebs, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said on Twitter.

It wasn’t known who was responsible for the phony Twitter accounts. A review of earlier tweets from one of the accounts showed some tweets that were written in Arabic that made references to praising Allah. Another account previously tweeted in Urdu.",2020-11-05T11:29:27.921Z,2020-11-05T11:29:27.927Z,
13,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/04/climate/paris-agreement-us-election.html,The U.S. Left the Paris Climate Pact. Allies and Rivals Are Pressing Ahead,"WASHINGTON — At the stroke of midnight Wednesday, when the United States became the only country to formally quit the Paris Agreement, the global accord designed to avert catastrophic climate change, it fulfilled a campaign promise that Donald J. Trump made four years ago.

But a lot has happened in those four years.

The costs of climate disasters have grown. Banks and investors have begun to turn away from fossil fuels as the price of renewable energy drops precipitously. Not least, key United States allies have rushed to stake out their own climate action targets. Britain, the European Union, Japan and South Korea have all said they would aim to neutralize their own emissions of planet-warming gases by 2050. And, in a shrewd move to outshine whoever is the next occupant of the White House, China, too, announced its own net-zero ambitions.

“The rest of the world has confirmed it will not stop action on climate change,” said Lois M. Young, the ambassador of Belize to the United Nations who, as chairwoman of the Alliance of Small Island States, represents some of the countries most vulnerable to sea level rise.

Ms. Young said she hoped the United States would recommit to the Paris deal in order to minimize the worst climate risks facing countries like hers. “That the country that has contributed the most to climate change is now formally outside of the Paris Agreement, and may remain so for at least the next four years, is an appalling thought,” she said.

As of Wednesday, the United States presidential outcome remained unclear, and with it, the future of what role the United States will play in addressing climate change. If President Trump wins, the United States will almost certainly remain out of the accord for at least the next four years, making it difficult, if not impossible, to slow the rise of global temperatures.

If former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. wins, he would bring the United States back in as early as February 2021. Or as Mr. Biden said in a Twitter message on Wednesday, “in exactly 77 days.”


But rejoining the Paris Agreement will be the easy part. The United States would find that it has a lot of catching up to do to both reduce emissions and rebuild trust with its international allies.

Teresa Ribera, Spain’s environment minister, said the election results would demonstrate whether the United States becomes “a confrontational power or a constructive power” on climate change.

It was not lost on Ms. Ribera, a veteran of international climate negotiations, that Washington has flip-flopped before, notably on the Kyoto Protocol. The United States joined that global climate treaty in 1997 under the Clinton administration and withdrew in 2001 under President George W. Bush.
Many countries, Ms. Ribera said, are eager to have the United States re-engaged in the Paris deal. But they also are wary about promises from Washington that it can’t keep, and are prepared to continue taking action on their own if necessary.

“Credibility is something very difficult to earn and very easy to lose,” Ms. Ribera said. “The recovery of credibility could take some time.”

Todd Stern, who served as climate change envoy under President Barack Obama, echoed that. After four years of an American president who denounced the Paris Agreement and mocked climate science, he said, it won’t be easy to suddenly make demands of other nations.

“I think the most important thing for the United States is to come out very strong and decisively on the domestic side,” Mr. Stern said. “We have to demonstrate that this really is a very high priority and that the new president is moving full speed ahead.”

Mr. Stern said rebuilding trust would require broad diplomatic outreach and aggressive climate action domestically. The American ability to do that depends not only on who is the next president but also on the composition of the Senate, which remains in the balance, too.

According to Carbon Brief, a climate analysis site, the announcements by the European Union, China, Japan and South Korea put nearly half of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions under net-zero emissions targets, which means they would eliminate as much climate pollution as they emit into the atmosphere.

That is, of course, minus the United States.

“The world has moved on,” said Byford Tsang, who follows climate diplomacy for the London-based research organization E3G. “This election wouldn’t change the direction of global climate action, but it can change the pace of global climate action.”

Mr. Biden has said he would spend $2 trillion over four years to rapidly move away from coal, oil and gas, and has set a goal of eliminating fossil fuel emissions from electricity generation by 2035. By midcentury, Mr. Biden has vowed, the entire United States economy will be carbon neutral.

That, combined with pledges from other nations, could make it realistic to meet the Paris Agreement goal of holding global temperatures to safe levels. The accord is structured around a kind of global peer pressure. Every country sets its own targets for slowing down its emissions growth, or, in the case of industrialized economies, reducing emissions.

Mr. Biden has made no specific promises regarding the Paris Agreement, other than that he would recommit the United States to its goals and “go much further.” He has said he would “lead an effort to get every major country to ramp up their ambition of their domestic climate targets” and “stop countries from cheating.”

Currently the United States is about halfway to meeting the Paris Agreement goal set by Mr. Obama to cut emissions about 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. A Biden administration would be expected to develop a new target by the time leaders meet for a United Nations climate summit in Glasgow slated for November of 2021.

It remains unclear whether Mr. Trump in a second term might rally other countries to undermine the Paris Agreement, or whether a Biden administration would successfully lean on other countries.
President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, who has echoed Mr. Trump’s dismissal of climate science, is unlikely to change his stance, though, some analysts said. Mr. Biden could exert greater pressure on Mr. Bolsonaro on environmental degradation and human rights.

India, for its part, is unlikely to overnight shed its appetite for coal power, though a Biden administration could nudge India to accelerate its expansion of renewable energy, which is where investors are headed anyway.

“The market case is working irrespective of Biden or Trump,” said Samir Saran, president of the Observer Research Foundation, a research group in New Delhi. “Of course strong leadership catalyzes this.”

Saber Chowdhury, a member of Parliament in Bangladesh who has attended international climate talks for a decade, said he hoped a renewed United States commitment to climate action would spur greater financing for poor countries and access to new technologies to switch from dirty to clean energy.

President Obama pledged $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund designed to help poor countries address climate change. It delivered $1 billion of the promised funding before President Trump stopped the payments.

“America is swimming against the current,” Mr. Chowdhury said. “There is a growing realization that time is running out.”",2020-11-05T11:31:23.832Z,2020-11-05T11:31:23.846Z,
14,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/5/egypt-ethiopia-sudan-fail-to-succeed-in-disputed-dam-talks,"Nile dam talks between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan fail again","Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan have once again failed to agree on a new negotiating approach to resolve their years-long dispute over the controversial dam that Ethiopia is building on the Blue Nile River.

In late October, the three African nations resumed virtual talks over the filling and operation of the $4bn Grand Ethiopia Renaissance Dam (GERD) project, which broke ground in 2011.
The renewed talks followed US President Donald Trump’s comments in which he said downstream Egypt could end up “blowing up” the project, which Cairo has called an existential threat. The remarks angered Ethiopia.

Foreign and irrigation ministers of the three nations met last week and delegated experts from their countries to discuss and agree on an approach so the talks could be fruitful.

But differences remained and Wednesday’s meeting failed to bridge the gaps, said Mohammed el-Sebaei, Egypt’s Irrigation Ministry spokesman.

Sudan’s water ministry said in a statement: “Water ministers of Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia agreed to end this round of negotiations over Ethiopia’s Nile dam.”

“This round … failed to make any tangible progress,” the statement read.

Sudan’s Irrigation Minister Yasser Abbas said the talks did not achieve concrete progress and that Egypt opposed a Sudanese proposal supported by Ethiopia to maximise the role of the African Union (AU) experts.

Ethiopia said the countries “were unable to reach a complete agreement” on items such as the “basis for the upcoming negotiation and the time frame”.

It said they would turn to the chair of the AU Executive Council and South Africa’s foreign minister “to consult on the next steps”.

Multiple rounds of talks have over the years failed to produce an agreement on the filling and operation of the vast reservoir behind the 145-metre (475-foot) tall hydropower barrage.

‘Great risk’
Key questions remain about how much water Ethiopia will release downstream if a multi-year drought occurs and how the three countries will resolve any future disputes.

Ethiopia rejects binding arbitration at the final stage of the project.

El-Sebaei, the Egyptian spokesman, said the three countries would separately report their positions to South Africa, which heads the AU.

Ethiopia is building the dam on the Blue Nile, which joins the White Nile in Sudan to become the Nile river – the world’s longest and a lifeline supplying water and electricity to the 10 countries it traverses.

About 85 percent of the river’s flow originates from Ethiopia, whose officials hope the dam, now more than three-quarters complete, will reach full power-generating capacity in 2023.

Ethiopia views the project as essential for its electrification and development and insists that the flow of water downstream will not be affected.

In July, Addis Ababa declared that it reached its first-year target for filling the reservoir of the mega-dam, which can hold 74 billion cubic metres (2,600 billion cubic feet) of water.

But Egypt and Sudan have expressed concerns the dam will reduce the flow of the Nile waters to their countries.

Egypt relies heavily on the Nile to supply water for its agriculture and to its more than 100 million people, while Sudan warned that millions of lives would be at “great risk” if Ethiopia unilaterally fills the dam.

On Wednesday, Sudan said it “cannot keep negotiating without an end and must guarantee the safety of its water installations”.

Sudan and Egypt have long called for a political solution to the dispute, rejecting any unilateral action by Ethiopia.",2020-11-05T11:32:58.521Z,2020-11-05T11:32:58.531Z,

Police detained some 300 people at unauthorized rallies in Minsk and the Minsk Region on November 1, Belarusian Interior Ministry Spokesperson Olga Chemodanova said on her Telegram channel on Monday.
""Nearly 300 people were detained for violating the law on mass events in Minsk and in the Minsk Region, and administrative protocols were drawn up against them,"" the spokesperson said.

Those detained had put up active resistance to police, she noted. In particular, protesters used an improvised explosive device. Police had repeatedly warned that any unlawful steps were unacceptable and took measures to thwart crimes, the spokesperson stressed. The law enforcement officers used stun grenades and rubber bullets.

An investigation was launched into active resistance to police and blocking traffic. A total of 13 protests were held across the country. Meanwhile, the spokesperson noted that ""protests in other regions of the republic did not significantly spread and the number of their participants basically did not exceed 10.""

Nationwide demonstrations have engulfed Belarus following the August 9 presidential election. According to the Central Election Commission’s official results, incumbent President Alexander Lukashenko won by a landslide, garnering 80.10% of the vote. His closest rival in the race, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, came in second, with 10.12% of the ballot. However, she refused to recognize the election’s outcome, and left Belarus for Lithuania. After the results of the exit polls were announced late on August 9, mass protests erupted in downtown Minsk and other Belarusian cities. During the early post-election period, the rallies snowballed into fierce clashes between the protesters and police. The current unrest is being cheered on by the opposition’s Coordination Council, which has been beating the drum for more protests. In response, the Belarusian authorities have castigated the ongoing turmoil and demanded that these unauthorized demonstrations be stopped.",2020-11-05T11:34:49.180Z,2020-11-05T11:34:49.186Z,
192,https://qz.com/africa/1932390/nigeria-ratifies-afcfta-despite-closed-benin-cameroon-borders/,Nigeria has ratified Africa’s historic free trade agreement—but its land borders remain closed,"The world’s largest free trade area since the World Trade Organization has taken one step closer to becoming a reality.

Nigeria has ratified the free trade agreement which will now come into effect on Jan 1 2021. It’s a key move for the ambitions of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) given Nigeria’s status not just as one of the continent’s largest economies but also as its most populous country.

When it comes into effect, the AfCFTA aims to create a single market for goods and services in Africa. By 2030, the market size across the continent is expected to include 1.7 billion people with over $6.7 trillion of cumulative consumer and business spending—if all African countries join the agreement. Yet, despite these prospects, and Nigeria’s positive outward stance, the country still poses a major red flag to hopes for free trade across the continent.

For over a year,  Nigeria’s land borders with Benin, Niger, and Cameroon have been closed as the government aimed to stop the smuggling of food items which it says undermines local agricultural businesses. It’s a protectionist move that’s in line with previous policies under the current Buhari administration despite little evidence of efficacy.
For instance, despite a hike in rice tariffs aimed at boosting local production, a lack of capacity to meet local consumption levels mean market gaps are still being plugged by illegal rice imports.

The biggest impact is felt by informal traders—most of them small and medium enterprises that operate along the Nigeria-Benin border. Nigeria’s high level of protection on products like rice has made smuggling from neighboring countries very lucrative. The World Bank has estimated 80% of imports into Benin are destined for Nigeria.

“Nigeria’s ratification of the AfCFTA is a welcome development, but the country’s commitment to intra-African trade should also be materialized in reality by the re-opening of its land borders,” says Landry Signé, a Brookings Institution fellow. “Re-opening the borders will send a strong signal about Nigeria’s intentions…to boost intra-African trade.”

Cause and effect
While the border closure was imagined as crackdown on a food imports, it translated into blockade on all imports and exports as well. The move has had far-reaching, cross-border implications from paralyzing supply chains to impacting import and export-based businesses. Kobo360, a logistics startup that matches businesses with freight trucks for cross-country haulage, says, in recent statement, that demand fell by nearly 30% within the first months of border closure.

Regular Nigerians are also paying a big price for the policy as food inflation has reached a 31-month high last month. Despite the Nigerian government’s best intentions, the country still remains far from being self-sufficient as local food consumption far outstrips production. SBM Intel, a Lagos-based market intelligence firm, predicts the spike in food prices “will worsen in the coming months if the borders remain closed,” especially ahead of the busy festive season.

As it turns out, Dangote Cement and BUA Group—two of Nigeria’s largest businesses—have recently been granted exemptions to the border closure and will now be allowed to resume exports. But the exemptions have resulted in public criticism and accusations of favoritism, especially given Dangote’s long-running close links with successive Nigerian governments.

For his part however, Obi Ozor, Kobo360 CEO is hoping the exemptions ultimately result in “broader and seamless re-opening of the borders.”",2020-11-13T08:46:25.947Z,2020-11-13T08:46:26.024Z,
16,https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-bank-of-england-unleashes-further-150bn-of-support-for-economy-12124096,Coronavirus: Bank of England unleashes further £150bn of support for economy The bank's latest forecasts reflect not only the deepening COVID-19 crisis but also disruption caused by Brexit,"The governor of the Bank of England (BoE) has told Sky News the economy is facing a ""historically unprecedented"" hit this year, hours after it ramped up virus crisis support by £150bn.

Andrew Bailey spoke about twin threats to growth from renewed coronavirus lockdowns and Brexit disruption after the latest meeting of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) that saw it unleash more quantitative easing (QE).

Interest rates were held at their record low of 0.1% - defying speculation among some commentators that it could opt for negative rates for the first time in its history to encourage more lending by banks and spending.
The Bank signalled that its work examining the effects on negative rates had not yet been completed.

As England entered its second lockdown of the year, it said additional QE now would help oil the wheels as large parts of the economy grind to another coronavirus-enforced halt - resulting in an expected 2% additional hit to growth by the year's end.

Mr Bailey said of the damage: ""Now we think there'll be a further downturn in the fourth quarter...so I think it's quite likely that the economy will end this year probably around 10 or 11% below where it was in terms of activity in the last year and that is historically unprecedented.""

The fresh QE also reflected, what the Bank called, an ""initial period of adjustment"" to be expected following the conclusion of the Brexit transition period, saying its influence was based on the assumption of a trade deal being agreed by the year's end.
It saw a 1% hit to first quarter growth next year, as a result.

The Bank dug deeper hours before the chancellor was due to update MPs on the support available to businesses and their staff from the government, including an expansion of the furlough scheme.

The size of the BoE's QE, or asset purchase programme, now stands at £875bn - £450bn of that being introduced since March.

It allows the bank to release cash into the economy to support everyday activities.

The Bank, in its update on Wednesday, said the economy would now remain below its pre-pandemic peak through the first quarter of 2022.

It had previously expected the recovery to have been completed next year.
However, it stopped short of forecasting a so-called double-dip recession as it expected that output, following a lockdown hit in the current quarter, would be positive to the tune of 2.4% during the first three months of 2021 despite the expected Brexit complications,

The Bank also upwardly revised its projections for the virus crisis hit to employment.
It said the marginal increase to a jobless rate peak of 7.75% this year from 7.5% reflected the government's decision to extend the furlough scheme.

Minutes of the MPC's meeting read: ""GDP is projected to recover further as the direct impact of Covid on the economy is assumed to wane.

""Activity is also supported by the substantial fiscal policies already announced and accommodative monetary policy.

""The recovery takes time, however, and the risks around the GDP projection are judged to be skewed to the downside.""

Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the bank's QE action implied it could spin the wheel again early next year.

He explained: ""The MPC's decision to increase its holdings of gilts by £150bn over the course of 2021 implies that weekly purchases will be 25% lower on average next year than at present, though the committee has pledged to maintain the current pace of its purchases initially.""

Bank digs deeper than expected for cold winter ahead - by Paul Kelso, business correspondent

The first day of the second lockdown for England brought a cold blast of economic reality from the Bank of England.

That interest rates remained unchanged at the historic low of 0.1%, set in the teeth of the first wave of Covid in March, was not a surprise.

Less well anticipated was that the level of further support the Bank injected into the economy. Economists and financial markets had anticipated another £100bn of QE.

In fact the MPC dug deeper, authorising £150bn of bond purchases, taking the total this year to £450bn, an extraordinary intervention underlining the economic havoc wreaked by coronavirus.

The decision has been taken on the assumption that the economy will contract further and for longer than previously assumed as a result of the second wave.
The Bank forecasts GDP will contract by 2% in the final quarter of the year, a reversal on the previous forecast of 4% of growth, and coming in a year that has already seen the economy shrink by 9%.

The forecast dashes any prospect of a V-shaped recovery and the economy now faces a double-dip contraction, though not yet a second recessionary period (defined as two consecutive quarters of decline).

GDP is now not forecast to recover to pre-Covid levels until the middle of 2022.

Unemployment is also expected to rise more than previously thought, reaching 7.75% by the middle of next year.

Brexit is also likely to deliver a sting in the tail of the year.

The Bank forecasts that even if the government reaches a deal with the European Union trade in both goods and services will be lower for the first six months of the year, not least because many companies are still not prepared for 1 January.",2020-11-05T11:38:35.909Z,2020-11-05T11:38:35.924Z,

The announcement by Prime Minister Ludovic Orban on November 1 comes as the United States seriously steps up its ""China strategy"" in Europe recently, inking a slew of declarations across the region designed to limit China’s role in telecom networks.

It comes shortly after the October announcements by the U.S. State Department that it had signed deals with Slovakia, North Macedonia, Kosovo, and Bulgaria on high-speed wireless network technology, joining what the U.S. administration of President Donald Trump has dubbed the Clean Network program, unveiled in August to ""counter long-term threats to data privacy, security, and human rights posed to the free world from authoritarian malign actors, such as the Chinese Communist Party.""

""The U.S. is achieving its goals in terms of limiting Huawei in Europe’s networks,"" Ivana Karaskova, the founder of China Observers in Central and Eastern Europe (CHOICE) and a China research fellow at the Association for International Affairs in Prague, told RFE/RL. “These agreements are part of a much tougher approach toward China from governments in [the region].”

The agreements mark a last-minute series of diplomatic wins for the United States’ wider push to counter China’s growing global influence and are a sign that disenchantment with Beijing is spreading in Central and Southeastern Europe, an area previously viewed as conciliatory towards China.

U.S. government officials have led a campaign across Europe and elsewhere against the inclusion of Huawei, which has been blacklisted in the United States for posing a threat to national security and using its technology to spy on behalf of the Chinese government.
China denies the charge and argues that the U.S. initiative is driven mainly by commercial concerns. Both the Chinese government and Huawei representatives have repeatedly dismissed claims that Chinese-built infrastructure is a security risk.

The bilateral agreements signed by the Central Europeans and Washington make no specific mention of other countries and do not explicitly ban specific companies from the networks.

But the memorandums are widely seen to take aim at Chinese telecoms giants like Huawei and ZTE that are building up 5G infrastructure all over the world, having also made significant headway in recent years across Central and Southeastern Europe.

“This shift isn’t simply about U.S. diplomatic pressure,” Karaskova said, “it is also the result of growing domestic concerns in Europe towards China.”

The Anatomy Of A Shift

The new additions to the Clean Network program are part of a harder line taken towards China across Europe, with 5G networks becoming a central front.

In October, Sweden moved to ban Huawei and ZTE from its 5G infrastructure, joining the United Kingdom, which announced similar measures in July.
Other major European powers such as Germany, France, and Italy have taken aim at those Chinese tech firms. While stopping short of outright bans, they have instead moved to restrict Huawei from participation in their networks by creating legal barriers and limiting how domestic industries can cooperate with the Chinese companies.

Elsewhere, multiple Central and East European countries -- including Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Slovenia -- have all agreed to work with the United States on 5G cybersecurity, signalling future plans to restrict or phase out Huawei and ZTE.

“The debate on 5G within Europe has shifted quickly, in part because of a change in U.S. diplomatic approach,” Erik Brattberg, the director of the Europe program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told RFE/RL.

""There is a recognition that simply pushing countries to outright ban Huawei is not always productive,"" he said. ""Now they are allowing countries to cite their own security concerns and make their own decisions to achieve the same result.""

The headway made to limit China’s presence in Europe’s 5G networks is particularly notable in Central and Southeastern Europe. In 2012, 16 countries formed an economic cooperation forum with Beijing called 16+1, which was expanded into 17+1 in 2019 with the addition of Greece.
The initiative was quickly co-opted into China’s far-reaching Belt and Road Initiative, which launched in 2013, with Beijing viewing the region as cheap access to European markets and a geopolitical foothold within the continent.

But the forum has lost momentum recently as European members have grown disillusioned with Beijing as grand infrastructure building plans for the region have not developed as expected and much-desired investment from China has lagged.

Growing concerns over Beijing's so-called “mask diplomacy” throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and aggressive “wolf warrior” tactics by its diplomats across Europe have also hardened attitudes and raised security concerns about China.

Growing geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington have also prompted many countries in the region to reevaluate their China strategies, particularly as the United States has escalated its focus on China’s foothold in 5G technology.

“The 21st century is becoming a century of rivalry between Washington and Beijing -- and increasingly there is less room for gray areas,” Vuk Vuksanovic, a researcher at the London School of Economics and Political Science and a former Serbian diplomat, told RFE/RL. “I think we are seeing a slow drift where many countries are seeing that their ties to the United States are more important than their cooperation with Beijing.”

Navigating A Rivalry

Against the backdrop of the pandemic, the European Union has taken a tougher approach toward China, labeling the country a rival and sparring with Beijing over issues such as human rights violations in Hong Kong and China's western Xinjiang Province.

But despite the more strained relationship, economic relations between Brussels and Beijing are still crucial, with the EU becoming China’s largest trading partner and China becoming the EU’s second-largest after the United States.

While many Central and Southeastern European countries have moved to restrict Chinese firms in their 5G networks, they are still looking to preserve ties with Beijing in other realms.

Moving forward, many European countries will be hoping for a more coordinated China policy with Washington that can allow them to pursue shared strategic goals without having to alienate Beijing as a partner.

This has countries across the continent closely watching the November 3 presidential election in the United States, where both candidates have proposed different styles, but similar views, in terms of their China policy.

The Trump administration has pushed a hard line against Beijing, but has followed a unilateral approach that has left the EU on the outside looking in and, at times, caught in the cross fire of U.S. policy moves.

Tension between the United States and Europe over issues ranging from trade and Iran to defense spending have also strained ties between Washington and Brussels in recent years.
Former Vice President Joe Biden has also called for tough China policies, signalling to Europe that Washington’s more confrontational approach to Beijing is here to stay.

“Most European countries understand that there is a growing bipartisan consensus in Washington to view China as an adversary and that would continue under [either] a Biden or Trump administration,” Carnegie's Brattberg said.

But Biden foreign-policy advisers have differed by calling for a consultative approach with Europe, saying that they would consult allies on any future U.S. tariffs on China and will adopt a more multilateral style that will balance concerns over how best to confront Beijing in Europe and around the world.

“What Europeans want is a United States counterpart that shares the EU view that China is a rival that needs to be checked but still can be a partner on some important global issues,” Brattberg said.",2020-11-05T11:41:28.195Z,2020-11-05T11:41:28.218Z,

The enemy used different types of grenade launchers and rifles.

No Ukrainian military casualties were reported over the period under review.

""In addition, contrary to the agreements of the Trilateral Contact Group, an enemy UAV was spotted flying near the village of Shumy to cross the contact line. Using small arms, members of the Joint Forces shot down the enemy drone,"" it said.

Since the beginning of Thursday, November 5, no violation of the ceasefire has been recorded, the ceasefire is being observed along the entire contact line.

On Tuesday, November 3, Russia-led forces also violated the ceasefire six times. One member of Ukraine's Joint Forces was wounded in shelling.

War in Donbas: Ceasefire violations by Russia-controlled formations
Since midnight on July 27, a full and comprehensive ceasefire has been in effect along the contact line in the JFO zone in Donbas.
The Russian invaders regularly attack the Ukrainian military's positions. According to the JFO headquarters, such attacks are an act of provocation to make the Ukrainian side fire back.
In particular, on September 6, they grossly violated the ceasefire in Donbas by shelling Ukrainian positions. One Ukrainian soldier was killed, another was wounded in that attack.
A recent violation was reported on October 30 when at 00:28 Kyiv time, enemy troops based in the village of Pikuzy mounted an attack towards the village of Vodiane. They used different types of grenade launchers. The shelling killed two members of the Ukrainian Marine Corps – Sergeant Volodymyr Bondaryuk and Senior Sergeant Mykhailo Starostin.

For those who have never been to Tegel, the fuss being made about its replacement and closure on November 8 may be hard to understand.

But for many Tegel — TXL in airport language — is much more than just an airport. It is a piece of history filled with emotions. Its story is one of struggle, perseverance and in the end one of success that was too much for it to handle.

When it was built, Tegel connected West Berlin to the outside world. At the time, West Berlin was like an island, surrounded by an imposing wall and barbed wire built by Communist East Germany. There were a number of ""transit"" roads and train connections that could be used to access the Western enclave. But they all went through Soviet-occupied East German territory. The only way to get around this — and East German authorities — was flying in or out.  

The original Terminal A building (see below) is so special because of its shape. Its six sides form a big hexagon. The center of the building is a large open courtyard for traffic and is used for pickups and drop-offs. This makes the distance from curb to plane remarkably short. From a car parked outside to the gate it was only a 28-meter (90-feet) walk. For good reason, Tegel was soon called a drive-in airport.

A Cold War lifeline
The area where the airport now stands has been used for aviation for over a century. At the beginning of the 20th century, airships were based there. During the two World Wars it was a military training area. After World War II, Berlin was famously divided into two, East and West. 

West Berlin was divided further among the British, Americans and French. When the Russians started the Berlin Blockade in 1948, West Berlin's existing Tempelhof airport was not enough to handle the airlift's needs. Additionally, passenger flights to and from the city were highly subsidized by the West German government. The cheap flights pushed up passenger numbers and soon Tempelhof was bursting at the seams.
With all that in mind, the French authorities started building a runway and provisional infrastructure in Tegel, part of Berlin's French sector. Amazingly, 85 days later the first planes were landing on the longest runway in Europe with supplies to keep the city alive. Afterward it was used by the military, but in 1960 it was given over to civilian use. 

Provisional buildings were built and Air France started commercial flights. Others followed. Then in 1961 the Berlin Wall was put up making Berlin's isolation complete.

A truly one-of-a-kind airport
The idea for the Tegel airport that we know today came from the architect Meinhard von Gerkan. Now 85-years-old, one of his first jobs was to design the new airport. With little experience he and his partners started planning in 1965. Construction began in 1970 and it opened on November 1, 1974. A year later Tegel had overtaken Tempelhof as the West Berlin airport. Today it is the size of nearly 650 soccer fields.
Besides being so close to the city center, the airport is unusual for other reasons. Each gate has its own check-in, security, customs desk and luggage carousel. There is no need to be ushered through a duty-free shop to get to the waiting lounge. Tegel is only about flying — not shopping, entertainment or eating.

Once inside the main terminal, passengers can walk a complete circle and get back to their original gate without going outside. It has 14 jet bridges that serve 16 check-in counters. The building's curves, angles, cantilevered staircases and use of concrete, glass and metal make it look a bit like a futuristic spaceship. The use of colorful signage evokes a different era.

Later additions were built starting in the 2000s, but they were only meant to be temporary solutions. Technically the airport now boasts five terminals, but one is basically a long hallway that was once a parking garage, another is a big faceless metal-clad hanger. Both are connected by covered outdoor walkways, not fancy trams or underground moving sidewalk.

A victim of Berlin's success
It isn't just the airport architecture that made aviation a singular experience in Berlin. During the division of the city, all air traffic to West Berlin was under Allied occupied control and only airlines registered in those countries could fly in or out, even the crew needed a French, British or American passport.

German airline Lufthansa was locked out leaving room for Air France, British Airways and Pan Am. After unification, other airlines were allowed to use West Berlin's airports. Lufthansa bought most of Pan Am's traffic rights and its slots at Tegel. As Berlin became a popular tourist destination the city's airports saw huge increases in traffic.
At Tegel that meant crowding. Soon many passengers had to board a bus to be taken to the planes for boarding or deplaning because there weren't enough gates.

Despite this growth Tegel never made it to the top-rank airports in Europe. Frankfurt, Munich and Düsseldorf had grown into major hubs while Tegel was mainly used to get passengers to such hubs for onward journeys. This is just as well since Tegel doesn't have a transit zone and passengers had to go through security again if they were changing planes.

A long aviation history comes to an end
Located near the city center and officially called Otto Lilienthal Airport in honor of a German aviation pioneer known for using gliders, today Tegel is the country's fourth-busiest airport. Last year it saw an all-time high of over 24 million passengers serviced by 65 different airlines. Well up from 2000's 10 million passengers.

Unsurprisingly the impact of coronavirus lockdowns have decimated passenger numbers and Tegel will fade away without a big bang when it is replaced by the much delayed Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER) on the outskirts of the city.
BER was dreamed up to take on the increased traffic, but part of the deal meant that both other Berlin airports would close. Construction began in 2006 and was set to end in 2011. Tegel was set to close right afterwards. That didn't happen as BER was delayed time and again. A referendum to keep Tegel open had strong public support, but the government said it was impossible.

Now the last flight to leave Tegel on November 8 will be an Air France jet to Paris. After that the terminal buildings and the surrounding land are supposed to be turned into an industrial research park. So far plans are sketchy, but that is nothing new for Berlin.

What is sure is that architect Meinhard von Gerkan and his firm drew up the plans for BER airport to replace his own Tegel magnum opus. Ironically things have come full circle.",2020-11-06T11:56:11.914Z,2020-11-06T11:56:11.931Z,

Police recovered a weapon and located a Hummer. It’s still unclear if the man arrested outside the center is connected to the alleged attack plot.

One big new apartment building in the Fenway is breaking ground anyway.

Development firm Scape North America closed this week on a $165 million construction loan and plans to start work by the end of November on its 451-unit building on Boylston Street, near Fenway Park. It’s the first large apartment building anywhere in Boston to launch work since the pandemic hit in March.

The $230 million project has been in the works for several years, and is the first of three apartment buildings the developer — which launched here planning student housing but shifted to build more general-purpose apartments — has planned in the Fenway. It won city approvals in January. Scape’s ability to find a lender at a time when financing for apartment buildings has grown scarce speaks to the strength of the neighborhood and Boston’s life science industry, said CEO Andrew Flynn.
“It really represents a testament from capital markets in their confidence in the expanding medical hub of Longwood, and the rapidly expanding life science industry in the Fenway,” Flynn said.

The project is being financed by Madison Realty Capital, a New York-based investment firm that’s also funding the Raffles Back Bay Hotel & Residences now under construction off Stuart Street. The private-equity-backed firm has made several large construction loans in recent months. Madison said it likes this project’s proximity to job centers such as Longwood.

Still, rents have fallen sharply in Boston as the pandemic has dampened demand from both students and young professionals. The median apartment rent has plunged 16 percent compared with November 2019, according to real estate website ApartmentList, and thousands more units remain under construction around the city, set to open over the next year.

“Boston has experienced significant growth in the areas of life sciences, health care, and technology, and this financing will ensure that workers in these sectors will have access to much-needed, reasonably priced housing options in the highly sought-after Fenway neighborhood,” said Madison managing principal Josh Zegen. “We look forward to working ... on an important project in the Boston area.”",2020-11-06T11:59:52.980Z,2020-11-06T11:59:52.996Z,

It had winds of 30mph, was located over Honduras and was moving west-northwest at 8 mph.

For Central America, through the weekend heavy rainfall from Eta is expected to lead to continued catastrophic, life-threatening flash flooding along with landslides in areas of higher terrain. Flooding is also possible across Jamaica, southeast Mexico, the Cayman Islands and western Cuba. Storm totals could be between 30-40 inches by the time the rain ends.

Eta is forecast to regain tropical storm strength over the northwest Caribbean Sea on Friday. Although the details of the future track and intensity of Eta are uncertain, Cuba, South Florida and the Florida Keys should start preparing for impacts from wind and rainfall beginning late this weekend and lasting into early next week. The forecast has slowed down compared to Wednesday, so timing of greatest potential effects for the Florida Keys and South Florida is likely Monday and Tuesday at this time.
Regardless of intensity, an extended period of heavy rain and gusty winds is possible for southern Florida. Several inches of rain, possibly up to 10 inches, is possible. This area is already saturated, which could compound the flood risk.

With more than 75 inches of rain so far this year, Miami is currently having its seventh wettest year on record. Other locations currently experiencing a top 10 wettest year include Fort Lauderdale, Fort Pierce and Vero Beach.",2020-11-06T12:01:12.606Z,2020-11-06T12:01:12.625Z,

Federal police said officers, including members of the anti-terrorism unit GSG9, searched premises in Osnabrueck, Kassel and Pinneberg county.

Police said that while the men aren't currently suspected of involvement in Monday's shooting, there is evidence that they had links to the attacker.

Five people, including the gunman, were killed in the attack, and 20 others, including a police officer, were wounded.

German federal prosecutors said that two of the men are believed to have met the attacker in Vienna this summer. A third man had contact to him online, while the fourth had no direct contact to the attacker but was in touch with people who knew him.

The prosecutors said they were trying to collect possible evidence during the searches and that nobody was arrested.

Authorities in Austria have identified the attacker as 20-year-old Kujtim Fejzulai, a dual national of Austria and North Macedonia who had a previous conviction for trying to join IS in Syria and had been given early release in December.

An investigation has been launched into why Austria didn't put Fejzulai under observation despite being tipped off by Slovakian authorities that he had tried to purchase assault rifle ammunition at a shop in Bratislava in July.

Austrian authorities have searched 18 homes and detained 15 people in the country in connection with the attack. Four of them had previous terror-related convictions and several others also had criminal records. Authorities in neighboring Switzerland also took two people into custody this week.",2020-11-06T12:02:13.664Z,2020-11-06T12:02:13.674Z,

Il personale del 118 sta facendo accertamenti su almeno due dipendenti che si trovavano all'interno della banca e che non sono stati feriti. La piazza, al centro di alcune arterie della zona adiacente al centro di Milano è stata bloccata. Diversi bus e tram sono fermi ai lati della piazza. 

I rapinatori asserragliati all'interno della filiale avevano tenuto in ostaggio i dipendenti della banca. 

""Sono entrati dai sotterranei, eravamo in tre all'interno dell'agenzia quando mi sono accorto ho urlato 'c'è una rapina' ed una collega è riuscita a scappare' "", ha raccontato il direttore della filiale. Il direttore ha parlato tenendo ghiaccio sulla nuca ed ha spiegato che c'è stata ""una breve colluttazione ma non hanno infierito su di me"". Non è ancora chiaro quanti fossero i rapinatori.

La polizia sta controllando i palazzi attorno alla filiale della banca dove questa mattina la banda di rapinatori ha fatto irruzione armata di pistola. Gli agenti sono intervenuti alle 8.39 all'angolo tra piazza Ascoli e via Stoppani. Secondo quanto riferito dagli investigatori, i rapinatori sono entrati attraverso un buco scavato da un palazzo adiacente. Una volta all'interno hanno sorpreso il direttore e due impiegate a cui, sotto la minaccia delle armi, hanno ordinato di consegnare tutti i contanti. Hanno potuto prendere solo il contenuto delle cassette di sicurezza perché la cassaforte ha l'apertura temporizzata e non hanno potuto aspettare il momento giusto. Dalle prime informazioni raccolte dagli investigatori sembra che il gruppo fosse formato da almeno 6 persone. Un tale numero lascia ipotizzare un piano ben studiato e che, al momento, non è possibile stabilire se sia fallito del tutto. Non si conosce, infatti, il contenuto delle cassette private svuotate. Durante tutta l'azione non è stato esploso alcun colpo di pistola né è stato ferito il personale della banca. I banditi hanno solo attivato un estintore per creare un diversivo col fumo e guadagnare la fuga.

The tighter controls were needed to curb clandestine immigration, said Macron, adding that the criminal gangs illegally trafficking migrants into Europe were often linked to terror networks.

""I am in favour of a deep overhaul of Schengen to re-think its organisation and to strengthen our common border security with a proper border force,"" Macron said during a visit to the Franco-Spanish border.

The president said he would present proposals to European Union partners at an EU summit in December.

Europe is reeling from two attacks in the past week that involved assailants who moved freely between Schengen member states.

On Oct. 29, a Tunisian man killed three people in a church in Nice. Brahim Aouissaoui had arrived on the Italian island of Lampedusa, which lies off North Africa, five weeks earlier. After being transferred to the mainland, Aouissaoui travelled into France by train hours before launching his attack.

The jihadist who killed four people in Vienna on Monday travelled to neighbouring Slovakia in July in an attempt to buy ammunition, Austrian officials said.

Macron said the recent attacks were a warning to Europe that ""the terrorist risk is everywhere"".


The proposals that Macron would put to EU nations would be based on principals he set out in a letter to citizens ahead of European elections last year, a junior minister said.

In that letter, Macron wrote that Europe needed a common border force and a single asylum office, strict border control obligations and for each member state to supply intelligence under the authority of a European Council for Internal Security.

On Thursday, the president said France would double the number of police manning its borders.
Nearly 628,000 non-EU citizens were found to be illegally present in the bloc in 2019, up 10% on the previous year, according to Eurostat data. More than 717,000 non-EU citizens were refused entry, the highest number on record.

France's border police chief told Macron there had been a surge in attempted crossings of the Franco-Spanish frontier since it reopened in June following the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions. Many came from Algeria and Morocco, agents said.

""We need to bolster our fight against illegal immigration and traffickers who, increasingly often, have links to terrorism,"" the president said.

Das Landgericht sprach Halid S. der Körperverletzung mit Todesfolge und der gefährlichen Körperverletzung schuldig.
Die Tat in der Vorweihnachtszeit hatte bundesweit für Entsetzen gesorgt – auch, weil das Opfer Roland S. bei der Berufsfeuerwehr in Augsburg gearbeitet hatte. Mehr als 100 Feuerwehrleute gedachten nach der Tat des verstorbenen Kollegen in der Augsburger Innenstadt.

Doch Roland S. geriet als Privatmann in die fatale Auseinandersetzung. Sein Beruf spielte bei der Tat keine Rolle.
Der 49-Jährige war am Nikolaustag 2019 mit seiner Frau und einem befreundeten Paar von einem Weihnachtsmarkt- und Restaurantbesuch zum Königsplatz gegangen. Dort war er in einen Streit mit einer Gruppe Jugendlicher geraten, zu der Halid S. gehörte.
Der junge Mann schlug aus Sicht der Jugendkammer zu, Roland S. erlitt in Folge des Schlages eine Hirnblutung und starb kurz darauf.

Verurteilt wegen gefährlicher Körperverletzung
Nach der Gewalttat verprügelte der 17-Jährige zusammen mit zwei Freunden den 50 Jahre alten zweiten Mann und verletzte ihn schwer. Dafür verurteilte ihn das Gericht wegen gefährlicher Körperverletzung.

Der 18-jährige Komplize wurde laut ""Süddeutscher Zeitung"" wegen gefährlicher Körperverletzung zu einer Gefängnisstrafe von einem Jahr und vier Monaten verurteilt. Der dritte 20-jährige Angeklagte wurde demnach für denselben Vorwurf zu einer Bewährungsstrafe ohne genaues Strafmaß verurteilt.

Nur einen Freund geschützt?
Die Verteidiger von Halid S. hatten auf Nothilfe und eine Bewährungsstrafe plädiert. Ihr Mandant habe einen Freund schützen wollen, den der Familienvater zuvor gestoßen habe.

Die Richter blieben mit ihrem Urteil gegen den Haupttäter unter dem Strafmaß, das Staatsanwaltschaft und Nebenkläger am Vortag gefordert hatten: sechs Jahre Haft.

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in a brief statement on Twitter asserted that the military operations “have clear, limited and achievable objectives — to restore the rule of law and the constitutional order.”

The northern Tigray region was increasingly cut off as Ethiopia’s civil aviation authority said that starting Friday airports in the regional capital, Mekele, along with the regional cities of Shire, Axum and Humera were “closed for any services.” And in Sudan, the acting governor of Kassla province said its border with northern Ethiopia has closed “until further notice” due to the tensions, the Sudan News Agency reported.

Some in the international community are urgently calling for dialogue as one of Africa’s most powerful and populous countries nears civil war, warning that it would be catastrophic and destabilizing for the Horn of Africa.

Communications were cut off in the Tigray region around the time that Abiy early Wednesday announced the military’s move in response to an alleged deadly attack by Tigray People’s Liberation Front forces on a military base.

Both sides issued strong statements Thursday. Ethiopia’s army said it was deploying troops from around the country to Tigray, and the Tigray leader alleged that fighter jets had bombed parts of the regional capital. “We are ready to be martyrs,” he said. Casualties have been reported on both sides.

It remains challenging to verify either side’s version of events.

The Tigray region borders Eritrea, which fought a years-long border war with Ethiopia before the two countries made peace in 2018 shortly after Abiy took office. The Tigray government and Eritrea don’t get along, and the TPLF this week accused Eritrea of teaming up with Ethiopia’s federal government to target it.

Eritrea remains one of the world’s most closed-off nations, but its ambassador to Japan tweeted overnight that “TPLF’s push for militarization, proxy wars & reviving the rules of military engagement in the region must cease now.”",2020-11-06T12:08:18.706Z,2020-11-06T12:08:18.728Z,

According to Artka Beglaryan, ombudsman of the unrecognised Republic of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh), Azerbaijan attacked a residential area of Stepanakert in the early hours of Friday with a heavy rocket.

He added that there's no data on casualties or destruction so far.

The frozen conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan along the contact line of the Nagorno-Karabakh region flared up on 27 September, with Yerevan and Baku accusing each other of unleashing hostilities. Armenia has declared martial law and - for the first time - general mobilisation, while partial mobilisation has been introduced in Azerbaijan.

The international community has strongly condemned the escalation and called on parties to settle their differences via dialogue, while Turkey has pledged its full support for Azerbaijan.

Yerevan and Baku have signed three ceasefire agreements since the initial escalation in September, but all of them were broken soon after entering into force.",2020-11-06T12:13:40.699Z,2020-11-06T12:13:40.718Z,

Con esta resolución, la Audiencia madrileña avala el auto de la titular del Juzgado de Instrucción número 51 de Madrid, Carmen Rodríguez-Medel, que el 12 de junio ya dio carpetazo a la causa al no ver indicios suficientes que justificaran mantener imputado a Franco por un delito de prevaricación administrativa.


Rodríguez-Medel señaló en ese auto que Franco no tuvo ""un conocimiento cierto, objetivo y técnico del riesgo que para la salud de las personas entrañaba la realización de manifestaciones y concentraciones” entre el 5 y el 14 de marzo. En el escrito, la magistrada aclaró que se trataba de un archivo provisional y denegó la petición de la Abogacía del Estado de sobreseimiento libre, debido a que el delegado del Gobierno mantuvo una “permanente inactividad jurídica en relación con las concentraciones y manifestaciones y la covid-19”, que se tradujo en que “no prohibió ninguna concentración ni manifestación entre el 5 y el 14 de marzo en protección del derecho fundamental a la salud”.

Cuando se abrió la causa el pasado 23 de marzo —nueve días después de que el Gobierno decretara el estado de alarma— la instructora ya reconocía la dificultad de saber si la actitud de Franco “merece reproche penal” debido a “lo absolutamente excepcional de los hechos” y la falta de jurisprudencia. Pese a ello, decidió seguir adelante: “Resulta imprescindible incoar diligencias previas y practicar las diligencias que se dirán, a fin de clarificar si estamos o no ante hechos delictivos”, escribía Rodríguez-Medel.

La resolución —avalada este viernes la Audiencia Provincial— incidía también en que el investigado “no recibió comunicación o instrucción sanitaria sobre este particular y tampoco la recabó de oficio de ninguna autoridad competente en el ámbito sanitario”, descartando así que los superiores de Franco en el Gobierno le empujaran a autorizar la marcha pese al riesgo sanitario. Rodríguez-Medel repetía esta idea a lo largo del auto y concluía en el mismo que “ninguna persona física o jurídica, pública o privada instó del delegado del Gobierno en Madrid a que prohibiera o restringiera de alguna forma la celebración de concentraciones o manifestaciones por razón de la covid-19”. “Si ese conocimiento lo tenían o no otras autoridades o instancias, no es objeto de este procedimiento”, señala la magistrada.

Los informes del forense también salían a colación en el escrito de la instructora. Basándose en ellos, la juez concluye que, “desde un punto de vista médico, no puede acreditarse la relación causa-efecto” entre asistir a las movilizaciones y haberse contagiado. Pero aprovechaba para añadir: “La aglomeración de personas supone incrementar el riesgo para la salud pública, pues las posibilidades de contagio de la covid-19 aumentan de no respetarse unas distancias mínimas”.

Las tres asociaciones personadas como acusación en el procedimiento (Unión de Oficiales, Asociación de Consumidores y Usuarios José María Mena y Asociación contra la Gestión del Coronavirus) recurrieron el archivo provisional de la causa.",2020-11-06T12:16:11.036Z,2020-11-06T12:16:11.071Z,

The flag can be found elsewhere online, particularly among posts by Croatians who joined the fight in Ukraine’s Donbass mining region. 

But one feature of the match-day photo from 2015 sheds fresh light on the scourge of far-right extremism in this southern Bosnian town, still deeply divided between Muslim Bosniaks and Catholic Croats since the end of the 1992-95 Bosnian war.

It’s the T-shirt worn by one of the supporters captured in the picture giving a Nazi salute, printed with the slogan SH-MO, or Skinheads Mostar.

The rise of the Skinheads since 2012 reflects the tightening grip of far-right extremism on Mostar, a river town scarred by war and more recently by far-right, white supremacist and neo-Nazi graffiti.

‘The trip to white Croatia’
In 2014 and 2015, as Russia fomented a separatist rebellion in the Donbass after annexing Crimea, between 20 and 30 Croatians are believed to have joined Azov, a battalion notorious for its neo-Nazi politics as much as its prowess on the battlefield against the pro-Russian rebels.

From the Balkans, Serb fighters sided with the rebels out of loyalty to Serbia’s fellow Orthodox ally Russia, while Croatian nationalists found common cause with the far-right elements of Ukraine’s resistance against Moscow.

Croatia, a country where conservative currents are strong and WWII revisionism is part of the political mainstream, has emerged as a key staging ground for the Ukrainian far-right’s international ambitions, according to the findings of a 2018 BIRN investigation.

And the links extend to Bosnia too, where a little over half a million ethnic Croats live. In Mostar, a town of some 100,000 people, they are the majority.

Devastated by the 1992-95 war, reconciliation and recovery in Mostar has been hampered by deep mistrust between Croats and Bosniaks.

Over recent years, the town has been blighted anew, this time by far-right graffiti, often accompanied by symbols and slogans of the HSK Zrinjski football fans.

Some of these fans have also made their way to Ukraine.

In 2017, on the eve of a World Cup qualifier between Ukraine and Croatia in Kyiv, Zrinjski fan and former player Ivan Ferenc posted a photo on social media, writing beneath it “The trip to white Croatia” and tagging himself as being in Ukraine.

Ferenc posted more photos from a popular pub in the Ukrainian capital in which Azov symbols adorn the walls. One of them was the Wolfsangel, an ancient runic symbol appropriated by Nazi Germany and, decades later, by the far-right battalion. 

“That is a very important symbol increasingly used in many countries,” said Professor Matthew Feldman, director of the Centre for Analysis of the Radical Rights, CARR, and an expert on fascist ideology. “It is a well-known symbol of the far right.”

Poisonous ink
Skinheads Mostar has also used the Wolfsangel, as well as the slogan ‘Born to Hate’.

A review of social media activity by some of its members reveals a passion for tattoos, particularly featuring symbols associated with white supremacists and the paramilitary Nazi SS.

These include the Black Sun, the Totenkopf death’s head and the Celtic cross, photographs of which have been posted on social media by Mostar tattoo artist Davor Skobic, who travelled to Kyiv with Ferenc in 2017.

Feldman identified the tattoo symbols as either directly linked to Nazism or associated with “racist or neo-Nazi skinheads”.

Reached by phone, Skobic told BIRN it was up to his customers to choose their tattoos. Asked if he was a member of Skinheads Mostar, as would suggest by the ‘SH-MO’ symbol that featured on a T-shirt he wore in one of his pictures posted to social media, Skobic asked if the conversation could be continued at a later time. 

“You should understand me, where I am, who I am,” he said. 

A short time later, a woman called back and introduced herself as Skobic’s lawyer. She demanded that his photos not be published and that, if contacted again, Skobic would respond “in a far worse manner”.

Skobic’s far-right sympathies, however, are plain to see from his Facebook and Instagram posts, one of which features a picture of a child and the caption ‘14 Words’, shorthand for the popular white supremacist slogan “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children”.

The symbol 14/88 is scrawled on walls across Mostar, 88 denoting ‘Heil Hitler’, according to the New York-based Anti-Defamation League.

There is no ban in Bosnia on the displaying of neo-Nazi symbols, but provoking and fuelling racial hatred is a criminal offence punishable by jail. 

HSK Zrinjski fined repeatedly for fan behaviour
Ferenc’s Facebook photos include one of him standing in front of a goal with supporters displaying the slogan SH-MO. Contacted by BIRN, Ferenc declined to comment for this story.

In another of Ferenc’s photos featuring the SH-MO slogan is a former soldier of the Bosnian army, Dino Lovric. On his left hand, Lovric has a Black Sun tattoo, drawn – according to Facebook photos from 2017 – by Skobic while Lovric was still an active member of the army.

The Bosnian defence ministry told BIRN that Lovric served for seven years, ending in 2018 at his request. While previously researching far-right groups elsewhere in Bosnia, BIRN identified another former soldier who displayed his far-right sympathies. 

BIRN contacted Lovric but he declined to comment.

Football terraces in the Balkans have long given voice to the region’s political and ethnic divisions.

“This trend is evident in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with fights between groups of Ultras, mostly divided along ethnic lines,” University of West London professor Alberto Testa wrote in a paper published this year on Ultras in Bosnia. “In a number of cases, however, violence has escalated, exacerbated by the legacy of conflict.” The paper cited HSK Zrinjski’s fierce rivalry with Velez, the Mostar side most popular with Bosniaks.

HSK Zrinjski, in a brief response for this story, dismissed the “stereotypes” about football fans being far-right.

But the behaviour of its supporters has cost the club heavily. Over the past five years, Bosnia’s Football Association has fined the club some 200,000 Bosnian marka, roughly 100,000 euros, for the flawed organisation of matches, the use of flares and fireworks by fans, political messages in the stands and the use of megaphones.

UEFA last year fined HSK Zrinjski 96,000 euros for, among other things, the improper conduct of its fans during qualifying matches for the Europa League.

‘They stand over the road, waiting’
The official HSK Zrinjski Supporters Club declined to comment for this story or help BIRN approach any Zrinjski Ultras.

The only Ultra who agreed to speak was Vlado Savic, one of the original founders of the Supporters Club. “Zrinjski means everything to me,” he said.

Savic blamed the far-right graffiti that has scarred Mostar on outsiders. 

“The guys in charge of graffiti have nothing to do with that,” he said. “People come from elsewhere and intentionally do that to defame us, make us look bad.”

But in his home, where he was under house arrest after being convicted of armed robbery, BIRN saw a photo of Savic and another man making what appears to be a Nazi salute. Similar photos on Facebook show Savic making the same salute. He denied it was a Nazi salute, saying it was simply a gesture Zrinjski supporters make when they sing the club song.

In the neighbourhood around Savic’s home, not far from the supporters’ club, far-right hate symbols are hard to miss, from the Celtic cross, a signature of the Zrinjski fans, to 14/88, swastikas and phrases declaring that the fascist WWII-era Independent State of Croatia, NDH, “will come again”.

The hate graffiti also adorns Mostar’s Partisan Cemetery, where Communist partisans who fought the Nazis during WWII are buried.

Every February 14, visitors to the cemetery mark the anniversary of the town’s liberation from fascism in 1945. In 2015, on the 70th anniversary, they were met with projectiles and insults hurled by a group of what one participant in the commemoration, Stefica Galic, described as “neo-Nazis.”

Authorities at the time said three people had been arrested, but that has not stopped such incidents from repeating every year, said Galic.

“They stand over the road, waiting,” she told BIRN. “Zrinjski supporters have some premises across the road from the Partisan Cemetery and they were already waiting there.”

The local interior ministry said those involved in the intimidation had been identified and prosecuted, but did not identify them when asked to do so by BIRN.",2020-11-06T12:20:46.120Z,2020-11-06T12:20:46.131Z,

Chalk up yet another major score for the IAF, at the expense of rival China — France has agreed to equip Indian Rafale fighters with air-to-surface Hammer (Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range) all-weather smart weapons.

This is apart from air-to-air MICA, METEOR missiles and the air-to-ground SCALP stand-off weapon.

According to the Hindustan Times, the Hammer is an advanced fire-and-forget weapon that can be launched at very short range of up to 70 kilometres without GPS.

According to officials, the weapons will be delivered to the Golden Arrows Squadron of Indian Air Force station in Ambala by the end of this month. The Hammer contract was reportedly signed between the governments of France and India in September. 

The weapon usually would have taken a year to be delivered to the IAF, but the French Air Force has decided to part with the weapon from its inventory to meet New Delhi’s urgent requirement.
The Rafale fighter is on the frontline of the IAF, which is currently on high state of alert due to People’s Liberation Army (PLA) aggression at points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Ladakh region, The Hindustan Times reported.

The second batch of three Rafale fighters flew from Bordeaux using air-to-air refuellers and joined the Ambala squadron on Wednesday (Nov. 4).

The eight jets are part of 36 fighter jets that are expected to reach India by mid-2022 as part of a ₹60,000 crore deal signed by the NDA government in 2016.

The Hammer weapon can be used for multi-target attack and has zero maintenance due to reduced life cycle cost, The Hindustan Times reported.

With data link capability, the weapon is aware of hostile environments and has full flexibility to strike at any target.

In addition to the use of a dedicated warhead and an air burst capacity, the angle of impact can be set up fora full vertical dive for maximum destruction.
While MICA features air-to-air kill at a maximum range of 80 km, the METEOR missile has a beyond visual range touching near 140 km, officials said.

The SCALP is an air-to-ground stand-off weapon with a 300 km range and a 450 kilogram warhead.

Shortly before 7pm on Thursday (November 11) reports started coming in about the incident at Edmonton Green Police Station, on Fore Street, in Edmonton.

Footage circulating online appeared to show a man get out of the car, pour a substance on the road - right in front of two London buses - and set it on fire.

Met Police officers were quickly on the scene and a man was arrested on suspicion of arson and a number of other offences.
Thankfully no one was hurt in the incident.

With an incident as bizarre as this and with UK's terror threat now at 'severe', fears quickly spread online that what happened was terror related.

The hashtag '#terror' was used in sharing videos of the incident and this was fuelled by reports of counter-terrorism officers supporting police at the scene.
Around an hour after the incident a spokesperson for the Met Police urged people to be restrained about speculation saying: ""We are aware of speculation on social media regarding the ongoing incident in Edmonton .

""We will release facts when we can – our information must be accurate.""

With rumours continuing to spread, at around 3am on Thursday (November 12), the Met Police released a statement, which read: ""Officers were alerted to a collision outside the building on Fore Street at approximately 6.58pm on Wednesday, November 11.

""A 45-year-old white man is believed to have left the vehicle before attempting to set fire to it using petrol.

""He was apprehended and arrested by officers on suspicion of arson and a number of other offences. He remains in custody at a North London police station.

""The incident is not being treated as terror-related.""
Commander Ade Adelekan said: ""This appears to have been an isolated incident and does not seem to be terror-related. I am satisfied that there is no wider risk to the community.

""Local officers will continue to carry out enquiries, but at this stage we are not looking for anybody else.

“I would like to thank the public for their response to the incident and would urge anyone with information about what happened to contact police.

Enugu State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Dr. Emeka Ononamadu, told journalists and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) that it could not conduct the Isi-Uzo state constituency bye-election earlier scheduled for October 31, 2020 due to the #EndSARS protests.

INEC had declared the Isi-Uzo State Constituency in Enugu State vacant following the death of its former representative, Chijioke Ugwueze.
Wife of the late lawmaker, Amaka Ugwueze, however, emerged Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, while the All Progressives Congress (APC) picked Macdonald Ejiofor Okwor as its candidate.

“In INEC, we see elections as a national issue and so, we cannot fix any date on our own, because of the present situation in the country as a result of the #EndSARS protests.

“It is unfortunate that people are still in fear and the police personnel are yet to come back to their duty posts due to the incident and we cannot conduct the election without the presence of Nigeria police personnel,” he said.

Ononamadu, who lamented the low turnout of voters in the last general elections in the state added: “We don’t also want to experience another low turnout in the Isi-Uzo state constituency bye-election, because we don’t want to arrive at polling units and see only 20 voters out of 1,000 voters coming out to exercise their franchise. We want to run inclusive, free and fair election that will be acceptable to all.”

Meanwhile, stakeholders at the meeting expressed mixed feelings over the conduct of the election.

While some argued that the conduct of the election was possible despite the situation in the country, others said the people should be allowed more time to overcome their fears and trauma.

Executive Director of Hope Givers Initiative, Onyeka Udegbunam, said the election might not be feasible this year as police personnel who were targeted during the #EndSARS protest had yet to return to work.

Also, Executive Director of Disability Policy and Empowerment Consult, Sam Obiefuna, cautioned against instigating fear in the electorate saying: “We should not take the issue of hoodlums too far, because if we allow fear among ourselves, the election may not hold even in January next year.”",2020-11-12T10:12:40.352Z,2020-11-12T10:12:40.365Z,
38,https://www.voanews.com/press-freedom/rights-groups-sound-alarm-over-waning-press-freedoms-nigeria,"Rights Groups Sound Alarm Over Waning Press Freedoms in Nigeria ","WASHINGTON - Nigeria is one of West Africa’s ""most dangerous and difficult countries for journalists,"" an international media watchdog has said.  

Expanded state surveillance, the spread of disinformation, and arbitrary arrests of journalists who report critically on the ruling political establishment were cited as the main obstacles to press freedom by Reporters Without Borders (RSF).  

In its 2020 annual World Press Freedom Index, RSF ranked Nigeria 115 out of 180 countries, in which one is considered the freest. 

Other rights groups have also expressed alarm about conditions for the media in Nigeria over the past year.  

The Media Foundation for West Africa said Nigeria was among the countries in the region where journalists are assaulted, attacked, or have had equipment seized and destroyed while covering COVID-19, the respiratory ailment triggered by the coronavirus. 
Nigerian laws designed to safeguard press freedoms aren't being enforced, said Lagos-based freelance journalist Orji Sunday. 

“Nigeria enjoys relative press freedom... because we have very robust documents backing press freedom in the country — but, in reality, there's very little to defend the beauty of [those laws],"" he told VOA. 
Under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, reporting on corrupt politicians, police brutality, human rights abuses, or even the Boko Haram insurgency, he added, is not only logistically challenging, but potentially dangerous. 

""These are the kinds of stories that journalists find a lot of difficulty having access to the information that should guide their work every day,"" said Sunday, who regularly contributes to the Al Jazeera news site, the non-profit environmental publication Mongabay, and The Guardian newspaper.  

 ""We've had journalists beaten, jailed, threatened, and their families humiliated, because they covered a story that a particular politician deemed to be very embarrassing.” 

In April, the U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that Ebonyi State Governor Dave Umahi questioned journalist Chijioke Agwu over a report about Lassa fever at a press conference and then ordered police to take him away. 

“Umahi then publicly accused Agwu of publishing ‘false and damaging’ information that violated Section 35 of Ebonyi’s new state law on COVID-19 and other infectious diseases,” said Jonathan Rozen, CPJ’s senior Africa researcher. Rozen said Agwu was released later without charge. 

In the early hours of May 9, Nigeria's Department of State Services (DSS) raided the Bayelsa state home of Naija Live TV founder Saint Mienpamo Onitsha, seizing his phone. 

According to the CPJ, the DSS agents drove Onitsha around blindfolded for hours before bringing him to a local DSS office, where he was interrogated and later released without charge on May 12.  

Nigerian law says police may not detain any suspect for longer than 48 hours without a court order. 

Nigerian lawmakers are currently reviewing legislation that would criminalize spreading false information online and allow the government to order internet shutdowns and block access to social media sites such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter. 

The 2019 Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulation Bill, which carries penalties including up to three years in prison or fines of up to 300,000 naira (U.S. $770), doubles down on Abuja’s efforts to criminalize free speech. 

""Nigeria has criminal defamation on its books already, so this is just another example of the criminalization of speech,"" Rozen told VOA, adding that the draft legislation has been criticized by journalists and civil society groups for being overly vague. 

If passed, he said, it could become Nigeria's latest tool for suppressing journalists. 

""There's already a Cybercrime Act, which was passed at the very end of [former president] Goodluck Jonathan's term in 2015,"" he said.  Rozen said that legislation was similarly vague and ""repeatedly used against the press."" 

Journalists in Nigeria also risk arrest. While the number of imprisoned journalists across the continent has remained fairly steady over the past year, the CPJ reported that ""freedom of expression is backsliding in... Nigeria, which does not bode well for journalists.""  

Accusations of being anti-state are sometimes used against the media.  
Omoyele Sowore, founder of the U.S.-headquartered news site Sahara Reporters, was recently charged with treason after a legal dispute with Nigerian officials. 

Sowore, who ran against Buhari in Nigeria’s February 2019 presidential contest, was detained in August for organizing nationwide rallies against corruption and allegations of unfair elections. He was held until late December, despite multiple court orders for his release. 

""It is clear that the right to freedom of expression is increasingly under threat in Nigeria,"" said a PEN International commentary about Sowore, who is on bail but restricted from leaving the country. PEN is a global network of writers. 

Officials at Nigeria’s Washington embassy did not respond to VOA’s emailed requests for comment. 

Aside from legal risks, Nigeria has a poor record in securing justice for journalists murdered for their work.   

At least five journalists have been killed in relation to their work since 2010, according to CPJ, which ranks Nigeria 12th on its 2019 impunity index.  

""We've had journalists who have lost their lives also along the way reporting some of the most important stories,” Sunday told VOA. ",2020-11-12T10:13:59.655Z,2020-11-12T10:13:59.688Z,

The child’s body was found in the teenager’s bedroom. It had stab wounds and covered in plastic.

The man’s wife was also arrested for having been an accomplice.

Gauteng Police spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said on Thursday that the child had been sent to a nearby shop on Tuesday morning but did not return home.

“According to the mother of the deceased, she had sent her nine-year-old daughter to a nearby tuckshop at around 7am and that was the last time the child was seen,” said Peters.

“The child was however, only reported missing at Eden Park SAPS around 2pm and police immediately activated a multi-disciplinary search party and together with some community members, started searching for the child.”

Police also interviewed the 16-year old assistant at the tuckshop that the child was sent to.

However, could not provide “satisfactory answers” on being quizzed about her whereabouts.

Peters said the search was then extended to the teenager’s room where the body of the nine-year-old girl was found with a stab wound to the upper body, wrapped in plastic.

“The minor suspect and the 36-year old tuckshop owner were subsequently both arrested and it was found that the latter suspect was in possession of a fraudulent RSA identity document,” said Peters.

The community also assaulted the 27-year-old wife of the tuckshop owner and injured her following her husband’s arrest. Police were able to rescue her.

“Further investigation into this case saw police also arrest the injured woman as an accomplice and she remains in hospital under police guard. The two male suspects are expected to appear in the Palm Ridge magistrate court today (Thursday), with the third suspect, the woman, appearing in absentia.”

Police have cautioned the community against meting out mob justice on suspected perpetrators of crime.

The three have been charged with kidnapping, murder, and contravention of the Immigration Act.

Peters again reminded community members that “there is absolutely no waiting period” to report a missing person.

The SAPS will give priority attention to cases where women, children and other vulnerable people are victims, Peters said.",2020-11-12T10:15:19.087Z,2020-11-12T10:15:19.096Z,

In a report on urban wastewater treatment for 2019, the agency accuses the utility of pushing back deadlines and of having “no clear plan” for 23 of the towns and villages on the list.

In all, 33 places are unlikely to receive treatment until an undetermined date after 2021, it warns – including Arklow and Cobh, which have a combined population of 32,000.
Meanwhile, treatment at 19 of of the State’s 172 large towns and cities, including Dublin and Cork, failed to meet European Union pollution standards – although this is down from the 28 places registered previously.
Some improvements are evident, the report accepts. Raw sewage discharges have stopped in one town, while improvements to wastewater treatment have been made in nine towns and villages.

However, Irish Water has “repeatedly revised its plans and extended the timeframe to provide treatment for towns and villages including those that are discharging raw sewage”, it says.

Director of the agency’s Office of Environmental Enforcement Dr Tom Ryan said raw sewage discharges pose an unacceptable risk to the environment and public health.

Reducing risks
Growing uncertainty in Irish Water’s planning and delivery of critical projects is undermining confidence in its ability to reduce public health and environment risks quickly, he added.

Defending the utility’s record, Irish Water managing director Niall Gleeson said €308 million was spent in 2019 improving wastewater treatment – up by €78 million from 2018. “We are making real and tangible progress,” he said.

The amount of untreated and inadequately treated wastewater being discharged has fallen by half since 2014, he said, while planning issues had delayed some other projects.",2020-11-12T10:18:04.560Z,2020-11-12T10:18:04.582Z,

The typhoon passed north of Manila between Bulacan and Pampanga provinces, toppling trees and knocking out power. Officials had said previously that nearly 200,000 people had been evacuated, some of them forcibly, from vulnerable coastal and low-lying areas.

At least one person died and three others were missing in Camarines Norte province, the country's Office of Civil Defense said late Wednesday.

Rescue teams were deployed to flooded areas in Rizal province near the capital, Adm. George Ursabia, the coast guard chief, told DZBB radio.

From the Rizal town of Rodriguez, resident Yolanda Laude called the radio station to ask to be rescued. “We’re all on the roof. The water has risen high and reached our second floor. We’ve been here on the roof since 3 a.m., there are six families on our roof,” she told DZBB, which asked for details of her location.

Azerbaijan and Armenia signed a Russia-brokered agreement on Nov. 10 to end the fighting and work toward a comprehensive solution. Aliyev hailed the deal as a victory for his country and a defeat for Armenia, saying Baku's military success enabled it to gain the upper hand to end the three-decade occupation.

""These are the happiest moments in the life of every one of us. The second Karabakh war will go down in history as Azerbaijan's glorious victory. All of our people demonstrated unity and solidarity in ensuring this victory,"" he said, crediting the victory to the ""professionalism and bravery"" of Azerbaijan's servicepeople.

The victory on the battlefield was a result of winning on the political field, Aliyev said, noting, ""We will further solidify our historic Victory in legal and political domains.""

Emphasizing that security and infrastructure issues should be prioritized for the return of displaced persons, Aliyev said some areas require de-mining and Baku will involve international organizations in the process.

He stressed his government will rebuild homes destroyed during the war, noting that damaged houses will be restored and lost property compensated for.

Relations between the ex-Soviet republics have been tense since 1991 when the Armenian military occupied Nagorno-Karabakh, a territory recognized as part of Azerbaijan, and seven adjacent regions.

New clashes erupted Sept. 27, and the Armenian army continued its attacks on civilians and Azerbaijani forces for 44 days, violating three humanitarian cease-fire agreements.

On the front line, Baku liberated several cities and nearly 300 settlements and villages from Armenian occupation.

Turkey welcomed the Nov. 10 truce as a ""great victory"" for Azerbaijan.

Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian, meanwhile, said signing the deal that allowed Azerbaijan to claim control over regions it took back in the fighting was ""unspeakably painful.""

Prior to the second Karabakh war, about 20% of Azerbaijan's territory was under illegal Armenian occupation for nearly three decades.",2020-11-12T10:27:47.664Z,2020-11-12T10:27:47.678Z,

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on Thursday expressed its hope for an “effective and substantive” code of conduct for all activities in the South China Sea.

Addressing the opening ceremony of the 37th ASEAN Summit as the current chair, Vietnam’s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc reaffirmed the bloc's determination to maintain “peace, stability, and security” in the South China Sea.

“ASEAN has also expressed consistently its principled position and a strong commitment to turning the South China Sea, a critical sea lane of the region and the world, into a sea of peace, stability, security and safety for the free flow of goods, where differences and disputes are settled through peaceful means, where the law is fully respected and observed, and common values are upheld,” he said.

Nguyen underscored the importance of the 1982 United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as the legal framework within which all activities in oceans and seas must be carried out.

“At the same time, we look forward to the early conclusion of the code of conduct which is effective, substantive and consistent with international law, particularly the 1982 UNCLOS,” he added.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo also stressed the importance of ASEAN's role in maintaining regional peace and stability.

Given the US-China rivalry, he said, it is very normal that both of them want ASEAN nations on their side, making it imperative for the bloc “to maintain its balance and strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation.”

In 2019, ASEAN and China completed the first reading of the draft of the code of conduct that was announced at the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in Singapore a year earlier.

The code of conduct is expected to be finalized by 2021 to resolve conflicts in the resource-rich sea.

The South China Sea – a crucial passage for a significant portion of the world’s commercial shipping – is bordered by Brunei, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.

China claims roughly 90% of the sea, which encompasses an area of around 3.5 million square kilometers (1.4 million square miles).

‘ASEAN to build health emergency center’

The Vietnamese premier said the bloc has agreed to establish the ASEAN Center for Public Health Emergencies and Emerging Diseases with Japan’s assistance.

He said the project will enhance the capacity of member states to respond to medical emergencies and future epidemic threats.

Nguyen added that ASEAN nations were working together in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.

He said some $10 million have been pledged for the bloc’s COVID-19 Response Fund and the money will be used to assist any country when needed.

As of Thursday, more than 1 million coronavirus cases have been recorded across Southeast Asia, with a death toll nearing 25,000.

Its loan disbursement only grew 4.86 percent yoy to Rp 934.35 trillion during the first nine months of the year compared to more than 11 percent in annual growth recorded in the same period last year. At the same time, the bank increased its loan-loss provision allocation by 24.2 percent to Rp 19.4 trillion as its gross non-performing loan (NPL) ratio increased slightly to 3.12 percent from 3.1 percent in the first nine months of last year. “The main supporters of BRI's loan growth are the micro and retail and medium segments,” BRI president director Sunarso said during a virtual briefing on Wednesday. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the country’s banking industry as the economic slowdown has caused loan demand to dwindle, leaving banks' liquidity to balloon while profitability falls and bad debt soars. As of Sept. 30, BRI had restructured loans worth up to Rp 193.7 trillion for 2.95 million borrowers. The bank’s president director said that so far most of the borrowers whose loans had been restructured managed to pay back their obligations after the restructuring period ended. Meanwhile, the bank’s third-party funds grew by 18 percent yoy to Rp 1.13 quadrillion. BRI’s loan growth during the first nine months of the year was notably higher than the Indonesian banking industry’s loan growth at 0.12 percent, data from the Financial Services Authority (OJK) show. According to the bank’s data, its consolidated loans for the MSME segment expanded by 8.28 percent as of September against the same period last year, with the micro segment growing by 8.91 percent, the retail and medium segment by 9.93 percent and the consumer segment by 3.81 percent. On the other hand, loans for the corporate segment contracted by 7.33 percent yoy. BRI expects its loan growth to reach 4 to 5 percent this year as MSMEs have started to recover, it said. On Wednesday, along with BRI’s financial performance report, the bank released the BRI Micro and SME Index (BMSI), which is said to be the first leading indicator in Indonesia to measure MSMEs' business activities. The BMSI consists of two subindexes, the Business Activity Index (IAB) and the Business Activity Expectation Index (IEAB). The former measures the current situation while the latter measures expectations for the upcoming three months. The Index is scheduled to be published every quarter. “We conclude that Indonesia’s MSMEs are starting to show a turning point after being hit by the pandemic,” Sunarso said, inferring from data showcased by the index. In the third quarter, the score stood at 84.2, an increase of 18.7 points from the score of 65.5 in the second quarter. The IEAB score for the fourth quarter, on the other hand, was 109.3, signaling optimism. A score of 0 to 99 shows that negative perceptions dominate over positive perceptions, 100 is a neutral zone, while a score of 101 to 200 shows that positive perceptions outweigh the negative. Indonesia’s small businesses account for more than 60 percent of GDP and employ a majority of the labor force. They are among the hardest hit the COVID-19 outbreak as the economy enters into recession following economic contractions recorded in the second and third quarter. Mirae Asset Sekuritas Indonesia analyst Lee Young Jun forecast that the bank’s net profits would accumulate to Rp 18 trillion by the end of the year. “While we maintain our top-line forecast, we adjust up our earnings forecast from Rp 14 trillion to Rp 18 trillion in 2020 as there won’t be any one-off deferred tax expenses in the second half of 2020,” the analyst wrote in a report published on Oct. 23. The bank’s shares, traded on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) under the code BBRI, dropped 4.13 percent on Thursday after rallying by 3 percent on Wednesday. The stock has lost 10.23 percent of its value so far this year versus a 13.35 percent decline recorded by the overall Jakarta Composite Index (JCI).

Australia’s agriculture minister David Littleproud confirmed news from the Australian Forest Products Association (AFPA) on Thursday that all exports of logs from the state of Victoria has been suspended from Wednesday.
The suspension by China’s customs agency follows a block on logs from the Australian state of Queensland two weeks ago after the General Administration of Customs of China found a pest, the bark beetle Ips grandicollis, in log shipments.
“AFPA is aware that Chinese customs authorities have notified the Australian Department of Agriculture, Water and Environment that it has suspended the export of logs from Victoria due to phytosanitary concerns, in addition to the existing suspension of log exports from Queensland,” an AFPA spokesman said.
“AFPA is working with the Department of Agriculture, Water and Environment to obtain more details from Chinese officials about these incidents and to address the issues identified.”
Littleproud told Reuters that the latest timber suspension concerning timber from Victoria was also related to the detection of bark beetles in logs exported to China.
States close to Queensland, such as Victoria and New South Wales on the east coast of Australia, were already on alert that the suspension imposed on Queensland logs could affect their shipments as many manufacturers and exporters source wood from Queensland for processing and shipping final products to China.
Last week, importers in China were verbally advised to avoid purchases of seven Australian products, including log timber, as tensions between the two countries increased.
Many importers have cancelled orders due to the increased risk of losses due to shipment delays, although orders already en route to China had largely been processed through customs, Australian trade minister Simon Birmingham said at the start of the week, although he indicated there were still delays with the clearance of lobsters.
A handful of shipments of Australian cherries were also met with delays, mainly at Shanghai airport, but the problem was not widespread and could likely be due to escalated coronavirus inspections for packaging contamination, import sources said.
China has taken coronavirus packaging testing seriously since it was found on imported shrimp in July. It has not only stepped up customs inspections as part of its biosecurity risk management, but has also banned several seafood export countries.
It has also banned imports from 54 meat processing plants globally due to the risk of coronavirus contamination concerns, including two in Australia.
The two Australian meat processing plants join four other plants that had their beef exports suspended due to mislabelling issues in May, just as tensions between the two countries started to escalate.
Bilateral relations between the two countries have soured since Canberra pushed for an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus, although cracks in the relationship appeared long before, especially after Canberra banned China’s Huawei Technologies Co. from helping build its 5G telecommunications network two years ago.",2020-11-12T10:58:54.899Z,2020-11-12T10:58:54.913Z,

As many parts of the world are reeling from surging numbers of Covid-19 infections and deaths, the WHO is due Monday to resume its main annual meeting, which was cut short in May.
But while the World Health Assembly (WHA) is expected to focus heavily on international coordination of the pandemic response, one international actor will not be present.

Taiwan has been excluded from the WHO and a number of other international organisations amid pressure from China, which regards the self-ruled democratic island of 23 million people as its own territory.

But critics insist this does not make sense.

They point to the territory’s remarkable success in combatting Covid-19, with only seven deaths and fewer than 600 infections since the start of the pandemic. 
The World Medical Association (WMA), a confederation of national medical associations that jointly represent more than 10 million physicians, called Thursday for that to change.

“The Covid-19 pandemic is proof that cooperation for and with all health care systems in the world is necessary,” WMA chairman Frank Montgomery said in an open letter to WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

“We believe it is both cynical and counterproductive to continue excluding the health representatives from Taiwan from participating in the World Health Assembly.” 

‘A big gap’
Next week’s meeting comes as the novel coronavirus has killed more than 1.2 million people and infected over 48 million globally since it first surfaced in China late last year.

The United States and others have long called on the UN health agency to at least give Taiwan back the observer status it enjoyed until 2016, and the calls have grown in urgency amid the coronavirus crisis.

Since the first portion of the 2020 WHA lasted only two days instead of the usual three weeks, members agreed back in May to postpone discussion of the contentious Taiwan issue until November.
Over a dozen countries, including Belize, Guatemala, the Marshall Islands and Honduras, have proposed to discuss whether to allow Taiwan to participate as an observer, but it remains unclear whether the issue will even be allowed onto the agenda.

Taiwan and its allies argue that the international community would have a lot to gain by integrating it into the discussion.

They also warn that leaving Taiwan out in the cold, without direct access to information, could threaten efforts to halt the pandemic.

“We cannot afford a gap when it comes to this pandemic, but we are seeing a big gap,” Taiwan’s ambassador in Geneva Wang Liang-Yu told AFP last week.

WHO chief Tedros has said Taiwan’s participation can only be decided by member states with the consent of “the relevant government” — a reference to Beijing.

But Wang insisted the WHO on its own “does have the authority to invite Taiwan as an observer.” 
Taiwan — officially the Republic of China — was a founding member of the WHO when the global health body was created in 1948.

But it was expelled in 1972 a year after losing the “China” seat at the United Nations to the People’s Republic of China.

Between 2009 and 2016 Beijing allowed Taiwan to attend the WHA as an observer under the name “Chinese Taipei”.

It lost that status with the election in Taiwan of President Tsai Ing-wen who views the island as a de facto independent nation and does not subscribe to Beijing’s idea that it belongs to a “one China”.",2020-11-12T11:00:52.232Z,2020-11-12T11:00:52.256Z,

Under the draft deal published on the government website, the Russian Navy will station up to four warships, including those with nuclear capabilities, and up to 300 service members in a Sudanese port. 


The yet-to-be-signed agreement also allows Russia to send weapons, ammunition and supplies for the warships and exempts Russia from import duty and inspection.

In exchange, Russia will provide Sudan free assistance in search-and-rescue operations and support in antisabotage efforts.

The geographic coordinates cited in the document suggest that the Russian Navy’s logistics hub will be located in the Red Sea city of Port Sudan. The Meduza news website reported a sighting of four vessels resembling warships at the location.

The agreement states that Russia’s logistics hub “is defensive and not directed against other countries” and “meets the goals of maintaining peace and stability in the region.” Russia and Sudan signed a seven-year military cooperation deal in May 2019.

Russia has in recent years pushed to regain its Soviet-era strategic influence in Africa with investments in its energy and mineral industries.

Russia recognized the new leadership in Sudan after longtime leader and close Moscow ally Omar al-Bashir was ousted in a military coup last year.

INTERFAX.RU - Шестнадцать наблюдательных постов будут выставлены вдоль линии соприкосновения сторон в Нагорном Карабахе и вдоль Лачинского коридора, сообщил начальник Главного оперативного управления Генерального штаба Вооруженных сил РФ Сергей Рудской.

""В целях контроля соблюдения договоренностей между Арменией и Азербайджаном планируется выставление 16 наблюдательных постов в зонах ответственности ""Север"" и ""Юг"", - сказал Рудской на брифинге в среду. По его словам, на эти посты возлагается ""сбор информации о случаях нарушения режима прекращения огня, оперативное доведение этих данных до командования миротворческих сил, а также поддержание безопасности движения транзитного транспорта и пресечение противоправных действий в отношении мирного населения"".

""Это будет способствовать скорейшему переходу к мирной жизни и возвращению беженцев"", - отметил Рудской.

По его словам, российские миротворцы в зоне конфликта взяли под контроль Лачинский коридор (соединяет Нагорный Карабах с территорией Армении) и участок дороги Лачин - совхоз Лысогорский и выставили там временные наблюдательные посты.

Рудской отметил, что ""подразделения первого миротворческого батальона 15-й отдельной мотострелковой бригады после разгрузки на аэродроме Эребуни, совершили 300-километровый марш и завершают сосредоточение в районе населенного пункта Горис"".

В зону карабахского конфликта за сутки переброшено более 400 российских миротворцев, восемь вертолётов, более 50 единиц автомобильной и специальной техники.

Минобороны Азербайджана 27 сентября утром заявило о начале военной операции на всей линии соприкосновения в зоне карабахского конфликта. По данным ведомства, азербайджанские военные начали ""контрнаступательную операцию"" в ответ на провокации с армянской стороны.

ADM and the local ACA cooperative have each had a ship waiting since Saturday to complete cargo loading at the companies' terminals in Puerto General San Martín and San Lorenzo, the shipping hub north of Rosario, according to the URGARA union.

Another ADM ship and one for Louis Dreyfus are also waiting to be loaded in the port of Bahía Blanca. The loading of a fifth ship for ACA has been stalled in the port of Quequén since Friday, said a spokesman for URGARA, which represents inspectors who check the quality of grains before they are loaded onto ships.

The URGARA union launched surprise strikes on Monday to protest stalled wage talks, impacting shipments in the world's top exporter of processed soy meal and soy oil, and one of the largest sellers of raw soybeans.

The striking workers have launched work stoppages in some cases and are refusing to work overtime, a union spokesman said.

""We are going to continue [with the protest] for as long as we do not receive a serious proposal,"" said Juan Carlos Peralta, a spokesman for URGARA.

A source from the agricultural export sector, who asked not to be identified, confirmed the delayed loading of the five ships.

Protests and strikes are common in Argentina's important agro-export sector, a leading global supplier of food. URGARA's protest comes at a time when there is less grain flow to ports due to the planting cycle.

• Commercial platform expanded – Lighthouse Navigation
• Modern fleet of 23 vessels with an average age of 5 years including newbuildings

Fleet status
Time charter earnings per ship in the quarter were recorded at USD 9 067 net per day versus BSI index of USD 9 435 net per day for the same period. Average net TCE per ship in the last twelve months amounted to USD 9 263 versus BSI index of USD 7 783 net per day for the same period, representing an outperformance of the BSI index of 19 per cent.

Our long-term outperformance of the BSI index is due to the portfolio of period charter coverage and outsized spot earnings earned by our subsidiary Lighthouse Navigation. The inherent lag in our business means that when the spot markets fall, our outperformance will tend to be higher. Oppositely, when the markets rise rapidly our performance will tend to lag on a short-term basis.

Approximately 30 per cent of remaining ship days in the next four quarters are booked at about USD 10 000 net per day. About 75 per cent of available days in Q4 have been booked at about USD 9 000 net per day.

BELINDA and BELNIPPON (time-chartered vessel) were drydocked in the quarter. The remaining fleet sailed without significant off-hire in the quarter.

BELFAST, an Ultramax newbuilding of 64 000 dwt currently under construction has been amended to deliver January/February 2021 instead of December 2020.

Belships’ fleet modernisation is set to continue with the delivery of newbuildings BELFAST and BELMAR scheduled for delivery during 2021. Belships’ fleet continues to increase and improve with only modest cash investments, signalling the competitive advantage Belships has in sourcing ship finance. Taking into consideration the recent nine acquisitions and two divested vessels at a net cash effect of about USD 3m. The Japanese Ultramax bulk carriers entering the fleet represent the highest quality and lowest fuel consumption available in the market today.

Commercial platform
Lighthouse Navigation has expanded its commercial platform with new offices established in Singapore, Melbourne and most recently Oslo. The aim of this expansion is to further enhance the vessels earning capability and to generate profits around cargo trading opportunities in the market. We expect this part of our business to expand further during 2021.

Sustainability
Belships is regarded as a market leader in corporate governance. Belships is also well placed and on course to deliver emission cuts in line with industry ambitions for 2030. A new carbon footprint study and review has been initiated with leading classification society DNVGL with the aim to monitor performance and identify areas for improvement. With continued fleet modernisation we expect to produce positive results.

Financial and corporate matters
At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents was USD 35.5m, while mortgage debt was USD 142.7m. During the quarter, the loan agreement related to the vessel SOFIE VICTORY was amended in order to prolong the maturity and reduce the loan margin. The group’s mortgage debt now comprises two loan facilities, both with a margin of 275 basis points above LIBOR and maturity in Q2 2024.

Net leasing obligation at the end of the quarter was USD 143.9m. Leasing liabilities have been calculated under the assumption that Belships will exercise its options to acquire all seven Ultramax bulk carriers on bareboat charter, whereas we have assumed that the company will not exercise the purchase options on time-chartered vessels BELNIPPON and BELFUJI. Belships has no contractual obligation to acquire any of its leased vessels.

At the end of the quarter, book value per share amounted to NOK 6.21 (USD 0.65), corresponding to an equity ratio of 32 per cent.

Market highlights
In the third quarter we observed a significant improvement in the spot rates with the Baltic Supramax 58 index averaging USD 9 435 net per day. This is compared to an average of USD 5 210 net per day in the second quarter evidencing a strong rebound since the outbreak of COVID-19.

As some economies began to reopen, demand rebounded from historical lows, with September being the first month showing positive year-on-year growth since the COVID-19 outbreak. Total Supramax shipment volumes came in at 261.3 million metric tons for the quarter, which marked a 9.6 per cent increase from 238.5 million metric tons in Q2. Of the main commodity groups, minor bulks and iron ore made the strongest recovery, growing by about 14 per cent. Seasonal grain shipments also increased markedly by 11 per cent, whereas steels grew by 2.2 per cent.

According to Fearnleys, new vessel deliveries dropped to 26 in Q3 from 43 in the previous quarter, which marked the lowest number of deliveries last two years. The orderbook delivery schedule for next year predict deliveries will be 25 per cent lower than this year, with 115 vessels scheduled for 2021 against 150 vessels this year. In 2022, just 28 vessels are currently scheduled for delivery, which would be the lowest number of deliveries since 2000. In relative terms, we are heading towards the lowest rate of supply growth in almost 30 years. The publicly quoted orderbook indicates fleet growth will drop to about 2 per cent by the end of next year (from currently 4.5 per cent) and in 2022 it will drop further to about 0.5 per cent. There will be changes to this outlook for fleet growth as the amount of newbuilding orders being placed over the next 6-9 months are uncertain and it is also normal that 10-20 per cent of the orderbook ends up being cancelled, deferred or simply incorrect. However, we expect very few newbuilding orders as lack of conviction for fuel and propulsion systems will restrain ordering activity in the near term.

Outlook
The Baltic exchange Supramax index in October averaged USD 10 202 net per day. Freight Forward Agreements (FFA) currently indicate a market for Supramax and Ultramax of about USD 9 400 and 10 400 per day for the remaining part of the year. The softer sentiment in the market during the recent weeks can to some extent be attributed to weak demand outside China, reduced iron ore and coal demand towards the end of the year coupled with usual seasonal slowdown approaching in January and February.

As we mentioned in our previous report, whilst total volumes shipped has rebounded, the supply side has needed to adjust in order to sustain a recovery in rates. The publicly quoted orderbook for our segment now stands at 5 per cent – historically low – and we expect this to lay the foundation for a potentially strong market in 2021. Furthermore, the average sailing speeds have increased which will help the fleet reach higher utilisation levels in a stronger market. We are therefore more optimistic in terms of market prospects, with the main downside risks to our outlook being short term potential lockdowns and year-end import reductions. Belships has a significant part of the fleet contractually covered for the next two quarters.

Belships has a uniform and modern fleet of 23 Supramax/Ultramax bulk carriers whereof nine of our vessels are financed with purchase option agreements. This creates substantial upside and flexibility to capitalise on a potential recovery towards historical averages for vessel values in the future. We are focused on maintaining a solid balance sheet and liquidity position. Our strategy is to continue developing Belships as an owner and operator of geared bulk carriers, through quality of operations and target accretive growth opportunities.

Performance Shipping paid $22m for the vessel, which has a $20.63m valuation on VesselsValue, with delivery scheduled for between November 15 and December 22. The premium in price reflects the vessel having completed its docking survey in July and special survey in October.

The tanker will be renamed Yanbu, and on delivery will grow the company’s fleet to five aframaxes in total.

Performance Shipping, formerly Diana Containerships, has completed a transition from a boxship owner to aframax specialist since announcing plans to transform in 2019.

Andreas Michalopoulos, installed as the company’s chief executive officer last month, replacing Symeon Palios, commented: “The acquisition of our fifth aframax tanker is an important milestone for our company; it marks the completion of the first internally financed growth phase, consistent with our corporate strategy and policies announced a mere three weeks ago. The acquisition will, among other things, reduce our indicative estimated daily cashflow breakeven rate by about $3,000 to about $16,000 per vessel per day, thereby meaningfully enhancing our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders pursuant to our variable dividend policy. It also marks our commitment to become a premier tanker vessel owning company. Following the delivery of the vessel and starting in 2021, we look forward to patiently and consistently executing our commercial and financial strategy for the benefit of our shareholders.”",2020-11-12T11:23:47.133Z,2020-11-12T11:23:47.206Z,
61,https://www.shippingherald.com/scorpio-tankers-bullish-amid-aging-global-fleet-refinery-closures/,"Scorpio Tankers Bullish Amid Aging Global Fleet, Refinery Closures","Tanker shipping company Scorpio Tankers is optimistic for 2021, highlighting its young fleet as well-positioned amid mature global tonnage and product transportation opportunities resulting from refinery closures.

Tighter environmental regulations on shipping emissions and a low global order book in the future favor newer fleets, company management said during a presentation accompanying the company’s Q3 2020 results on Nov. 5.

“Scorpio is well positioned for future regulation as it operates the largest and youngest fleet with an average of 4.9 years,” the presentation said. By contrast, 46% of the global fleet of handysize product tankers are 15 years or older and 69% will be in 2023, management said. In the case of MR vessels, the figures are 22% and 40%, respectively.

On the supply side, the company is comfortable this will support rates in the coming months and years, CEO Emanuele A. Lauro said during a conference call accompanying the results.

In the near term, though, Scorpio Tankers’ Commercial Director Lars Nielsen said that the unwinding of floating storage for petroleum products has put bearish pressure on freight at the start of the fourth quarter. According to the presentation, product floating storage inventories declined from 107.3 million barrels in May to 36.9 million barrels in October, putting many ships back in play into the spot market.

Nielsen said that a second-wave contango spurring on another wave of floating storage demand was unlikely in the fourth quarter as diesel and gasoline stocks continue to draw in the US Gulf Coast region, with inventories having declined by 23.3 million barrels since July according to US Energy Information Administration data. Additionally, with refineries in extended turnaround and not producing as much, demand for floating storage would likely only arise under a sudden and surprising lockdown in which the oil has already been produced and needs to find a home, specifically on a ship, Nieslen said.

On the crude storage side, though, floating storage levels have not come off as quickly, according to Scorpio’s Senior Financial Analyst James Doyle, with the largest product exporters able to access local crude as feedstock.

Data intelligence firm Kpler estimates that floating crude storage volumes were at 129 million barrels for the week beginning Nov. 1, the lowest since mid-April.

Floating crude volumes peaked at over 230 million barrels in late June, but there has been a steady decline since then as some VLCCs and Suezmaxes have come out of storage. The Kpler data estimates the volume of oil on tankers that are idled offshore for seven days or more.

Alphatanker, a market analysis division of shipping brokerage BRS, said the economics of storing crude on a VLCC could be supportive of a short-term, three-month floating storage play.

S&P Global Platts Analytics said the economics for floating are not compelling despite a moderately deeper contango but said some sellers might put some ‘distressed barrels’ on storage as a containment measure.

Refining hopes

Scorpio highlighted potential support from developments in the refining industry. Oil refineries face a wave of closures due to weak refining margins, tightening environmental rules and overseas competition, prompting some owners to opt for closure or converting plants for storage or biofuels production, according to the Scorpio presentation.

After closing, the lost production in these regions is likely to be replaced through imports, management said. This bodes well for tankers, Lauro said.

Market sources are bearish about Q4 fundamentals. Limited signs of recovery in oil prices and structural oversupply are likely to weigh on tanker spot markets, they said.

Scrubber play

Analysis of the company’s fleet revealed a high proportion of exhaust gas cleaning systems, or scrubbers.

The Q3 report showed of the138 vessels in the fleet, 93 were equipped with scrubbers and 24 “have yet to be installed.”

Scrubbers allow ship operators to avoid buying more expensive 0.5% sulfur fuel oil, which complies with the International Maritime Organization’s sulfur cap for marine emissions on the high seas and burn cheaper 3.5%S fuel oil instead. The wider the spread between 0.5%S FO and 3.5%S FO, known as the hi-5, the shorter the payback term for scrubbers.

The 0.5% sulfur cap came into effect on Jan. 1 2020. S&P Global Platts assessed the hi-5 at $296/mt on Jan.2, since then it has slumped and Platts assessed it Nov. 4 at $45/mt.

Scorpio Tankers’ sister company Scorpio Bulkers had adopted a similar policy, fitting 54% of its fleet with 48 with scrubbers. The dry bulk company said in in August that it was transitioning from freight and selling vessels to wind turbine vessels.",2020-11-12T11:24:29.203Z,2020-11-12T11:24:29.251Z,

The 51-year-old man and 55-year-old woman were arrested Nov. 3 after an investigation by the Alberta Law Enforcement Response Team’s (ALERT) human trafficking unit.
Investigators believe there are victims they have not yet reached and encourage them to come forward along with anyone who may have suspicions or knowledge of human trafficking.

ALERT started investigating human trafficking in Alberta in April.

Staff Sgt. Lance Parker, of ALERT’s human trafficking unit, said police were investigating the couple for about a month before laying charges. With the unit being so new, he said he doesn’t know yet how large of a program human trafficking is in the province but hinted that more charges will be announced in the near future.

“This was a two-person operation but (human trafficking is) definitively international or national at the very least,” he said. “Our victims come from all over. Pre-(COVID-19) it was pretty easy to move people around. Now during COVID, I’m not sure it is as easy but it is still happening.”

Parker wouldn’t confirm how many victims were involved in this investigation or their ages but said the girls who were involved were teenagers.

He said the goal of the unit is to better understand these kinds of crimes in order to conduct more effective investigations.

“Our victims do come from out east and Eastern Canada and in Western Canada,” Parker said. “Wherever the ports are. We’re just starting to identify that the victims are coming from everywhere. There are victims that are in Alberta, too.”

Kate Quinn, executive director of the Centre to End All Sexual Exploitation (CEASE), said she works with many people who have been sexually exploited, which has many elements found in human trafficking such as luring and grooming.

She said traffickers attempt to gain people’s trust in a number of ways such as being someone’s boyfriend or girlfriend or acting in someone’s best interest like a parent.

“Many minors and young people don’t feel they’re being trafficked at the beginning of their experience so they don’t often report to police or to youth workers because of what we call a traumatic love bond,” Quinn said. “Those who are traffickers know how to prey upon the vulnerabilities, especially of young people. We all want to be loved, we all want to be protected. They use that human need and then begin to control them.”

Article content continued
She said the impacts on a person who has been sexually exploited can have long-lasting effects, with some experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety and using substances to numb the pain.

Quinn said Alberta is still working to fully understand the problem, including why there is a demand.

“Truthfully, if there were not some men seeking to buy sex services from minors, if there were not some men seeking to buy sex services online from women, the traffickers wouldn’t see a profit motive,” she said. “I think the big challenge in Alberta is to really try to understand who these men are who are seeking to buy sex services. They are driving the market for traffickers.”

Ross Pickering is charged with trafficking in a person; advertising the sexual services of another person; procuring; procuring a person under the age of 18; and obtaining material benefit from trafficking a person.

Anita Pickering is charged with trafficking in a person; procuring; and obtaining material benefit from trafficking a person.

Patrick.

Joseph Church pleaded guilty Feb. 21 on the first day trial was set to begin.

Today, U.S. District Judge George C. Hanks Jr. handed Church a 400-month term of imprisonment. In handing down the sentence, the court noted Church’s conduct forever altered the lives of the women he victimized. Judge Hanks referenced how Church caused the victims to engage in commercial sex for his financial gain, mentioning he can’t prey on people in disadvantaged situations and then use those circumstances to make money. He further stated the court must make sure others do not follow in this ringleader’s footsteps.

After serving his sentence, he will be on supervised release for the rest of his life.  

“Church exploited, manipulated and controlled multiple child victims in our community and directed his co-conspirators to do the same,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Perrye K. Turner. “The individuals who choose to prey on the youth and innocent are some of the most egregious criminals in society. We will continue to work tirelessly with our law enforcement partners to disrupt human trafficking organizations and bring justice on behalf of the innocent victims they prey on.”

“Thanks to the investigative efforts of Department of Public Safety (DPS) special agents, our supporting crime analysts and our FBI and local partners, Church and his co-conspirators can no longer use high schools to recruit young girls into human trafficking,” said Texas DPS Regional Director Jason Taylor. “The collaborative efforts among investigating agencies helped to ensure the defendants won’t be a threat to our communities and gives the victims an opportunity to begin the healing process.”

Co-defendant Angela Marks, 26, also of Sweeny, who was Church’s girlfriend and pregnant with his child at the time of the sex trafficking conspiracy had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors and three counts of sex trafficking of minors. She was previously sentenced to 132 months in prison.

The young girls were induced into posing for pictures used in online advertisements for sex and engaged in commercial sex acts for money. Church and others collected all of the money the girls earned. Church transported victims to commercial sex dates and used motels to harbor the minors. Cell phone applications were used to monitor the victims and post online advertisements featuring the minors. Church and his co-defendants were aware the victims were under the age of 18 when they caused them to engage in commercial sex.  

Church, the leader of the group, is among 14 who have pleaded guilty for their respective roles in the sex trafficking conspiracy, gun charges, the posting of the commercial sex ads and attempt to cover-up their crimes.

Jamaal Crane, 28, Angleton, received a 180-month sentence, while Stephanie Walker, 38, Bay City; Eric Page, 22, Sherman; and Ronnie Beasley, 22, Rosharon, were sentenced to 135, 120 and 107 months, respectively. The court ordered Wharton residents Jamier Coleman, 23, and Lurkesha Baugh, 38, to serve respective terms of 105 and 27 months. Norris Moon, 26, Brazoria, and Tavius Whalon, 39, LaMarque, each will serve 60 months of imprisonment. Alisa Kimbler, 28, Freeport, was sentenced to serve 25 months, while Christopher Walton, 26, Brazoria, received a 21-month term of imprisonment.

The final defendant - William Franklin, 21, Wharton - pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit sex  trafficking of two minor females in a separate, but related case. He received a sentence of 140 months in federal prison.

Church has and will remain in custody pending transfer to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future.

The FBI and DPS conducted the investigation with assistance of sheriff’s offices in Brazoria and Galveston Counties and police departments in Galveston, Sherman, Wharton, La Marque and the University of Texas Medical Branch. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sherri Zack and Sebastian Edwards prosecuted the case.",2020-11-12T11:37:38.970Z,2020-11-12T11:37:39.043Z,

Europol, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom coordinated a Europe-wide joint action day targeting child trafficking. The operation, also supported by Frontex, took place between 5 and 11 October 2020 and involved 12* countries. 

A wide range of law enforcement authorities including police, immigration and border control agencies, transport police, social assistance and child protection services and labour inspectorates participated in the joint action.

388 ARRESTS AND 249 POTENTIAL VICTIMS
The actions led to 388 arrests, 19 additional suspects identified and 40 new investigations initiated. Overall, 249 potential victims of human trafficking were identified, 61 of which were confirmed to be minors and the ages of 107 victims have not yet been determined.

The involved national authorities focused on border crossings and main transport hubs to identify potential victims and suspects of human trafficking. Each country adapted the activities according to the forms of child trafficking which were nationally prevalent.

UNDERREPORTED CRIME AFFECTING THE MOST VULNERABLE
Human traffickers target the most vulnerable groups and children are among them. Child trafficking remains, however, underreported. Minors are trafficked for sexual and labour exploitation. Criminals abuse children while forcing them to beg or commit crimes such as smuggling of illegal goods and petty crimes. 

Within the EU, children are mostly trafficked by their relatives. These criminal organisations, connected through large clan networks, operate in several countries and move the children on a rotational basis. They abuse them in sexual exploitation, forced begging and forced criminality schemes. Trafficked minors from non-EU countries are also often victims of migrant smugglers collaborating with adults who accompany the children while pretending to be their relatives or legal guardians.

The victim slept in a storage room and bathed in a mop bucket, authorities said.

Amarjit and Balwinder Mann, both 66, allegedly threatened the victim with deportation if he reported them to law enforcement. The Manns have been charged with felony human trafficking, witness intimidation and wage theft involving four victims, the DA's office said. They face prison time if convicted.
The Manns, owners of M&M Liquors on Westwood Drive in Gilroy, recruited their workers from India with promises of travel and financial independence. Prosecutors estimate the couple stole more than $150,000 in wages from the victim and three other employees.

""Slavery officially was abolished in 1865,"" District Attorney Jeff Rosen said. ""Tragically, we are seeing examples of it in 2020.""

An Alcoholic Beverage Control inspection first discovered the victim in February. The agents found evidence of a man who appeared to be living in a small storage room in the back area of the store, a red flag for human trafficking, the DA's office said.

Agents found a thin mattress on top of milk crates, an office desk with folded clothes in the drawers and pots and pans on top of the desk, officials said. There was a mop sink with a faucet about three feet off the ground and a shampoo bottle.

The victim had flown from India in 2019 expecting to travel to the U.S. with the couple. Instead, the Manns took his money and passport and put him to work without pay or a key to leave the store at night, investigators said.

(KABC) -- A man was shot and wounded by Anaheim police Monday as officers were investigating a ransom case involving undocumented immigrants from Mexico, authorities said.

Police were called about 11:30 p.m. Sunday by a family member of a 17-year-old human trafficking victim, Anaheim police Sgt. Shane Carringer said.

The suspects smuggled undocumented immigrants and then held them for ransom inside an apartment building on Syracuse Street north of Lincoln Avenue, Carringer said.

Police placed the apartment building under surveillance, and while officers were surveying the location, they were approached by a man now tied to the human trafficking scheme.

A confrontation ensued, resulting in the shooting around 6 a.m. in the 100 block of North Syracuse Street, according to Carringer.

The suspect, whose name was not immediately released, fled to a nearby mobile home park. Officers located him, and he was taken to an area hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, authorities said. A weapon was recovered.

Meanwhile, the SWAT operation continued with flashbangs deployed as they served a search warrant. Inside, they found the original victim and a mix of other victims and suspects, leading to three arrests.

""This was a fairly sophisticated operation, just by the amount of people they had here at one time,"" Carringer said.

Investigators said some of the undocumented immigrants found in the apartment may not have been held against their will, and not all of them came from Mexico at the same time

The three-day effort was called ""Operation Autumn Hope."" It targeted various forms of human trafficking, and netted 177 arrests throughout Ohio, and rescued 109 victims.

This operation was made up of 50 law enforcement agencies and community partners who aimed to break the cycle of sex trafficking.
The PACT unit zeroed in on streets where prostitution was visible.

""We made a lot of arrests where we rescued victims, but we worked both the supply and the demand side, so we arrested Johns as well,"" Deputy Chief, Jennifer Knight said.

The PACT unit focused its efforts on various Columbus neighborhoods in what Knight calls the largest operation to target human trafficking in the state's history.

Under ""Operation Autumn Hope,"" agencies throughout Ohio focused on victims of human trafficking and referring them to social services, recovering missing and exploited children, and arresting predators.

In those three days ,16 people were arrested on the city's south side.

Knight said when women involved in prostitution are arrested, it's a mechanism for getting them away from their trafficker.

""After we searched them and went through the process of identifying these women, we would debrief them for who their trafficker was and whether or not there was a connection to a bigger human trafficking case,"" Knight said.
The women were also offered them onsite medical care and a path out.

""It is a continued connection with services, an opportunity to talk to someone about CATCH court, an opportunity to get someone addiction help,"" Knight said.

She said many of the children rescued in this statewide operation were teens and pre-teens. Some were rescued from their trafficker. Others were rescued because it was clear they are at risk of being trafficked.

""These are victims. They're very frightened, and I'll be honest with you, a lot of times it can be a family member who is trafficking them,"" Knight said.

Knight said she is hoping to work with the City Attorney's Office and City Council on legislative changes to make sure there are significant consequences for people who pick up prostitutes.",2020-11-12T11:41:48.813Z,2020-11-12T11:41:48.913Z,

That’s according to maritime security company Dryad Global, which noted that the crew retreated to the citadel and armed guards onboard the tanker displayed their weapons and fired three shots at the speed boat. This action was said to have resulted in the pirates aborting their pursuit and heading away.

Dryad Global highlighted that this is the third incident in the waters off Bayelsa State, with the previous two incidents occurring 107nm South of Lagos and 94nm South West Brass. Both previous incidents resulted in vessels boarded, Dryad Global revealed.

“With a further failed attempt it is highly likely that the perpetrators will increase in desperation in their attempts to secure their objective which remains most likely the kidnapping of crew for ransom,” Dryad Global said in a company statement posted on its website.

“As such the risk profile for the region is to be considered critical at this time with incidents assessed as highly likely/expected within days,” Dryad Global added in the statement.

“Following the end of the SW monsoon season, attacks are known to increase in frequency as conditions become more favorable. Whilst incident volumes overall are showing a partial increase on those of 2019 there is a significant increase in the volume of kidnap incidents across a prolonged timeframe and corresponding numbers of personnel kidnapped,” Dryad Global continued.

Before the age of European colonialism, the strait was considered an important trading zone, as it connected the Indian Ocean to China.

Since the arrival of Europeans and the founding of Singapore in 1819, the strait has become one of the busiest in the world, with a traffic volume of around 100,000 vessels per year.

In the last couple of years, the Singapore Strait has also seen an increasing number of pirate attacks. According to data from the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery Against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP), in 2019 a total of 31 piracy incidents took place in the strait, compared to seven recorded in 2018.

The latest incidents took place between 25 and 26 October, when three ships moving through the Strait’s eastbound lane were approached by armed robbers. With these attacks, which took place within intervals of two hours, a total of six incidents were reported in October – the highest number reported in one month.

Despite attempts from Japanese and Singaporean authorities to combat piracy – the situation is worsening, with a growing number of incidents – 28 since January with the inclusion of the October attacks – causing concern for shippers in the region.

 

Singapore and the wider Asian context
Pirate attacks that take place near Singapore differ profoundly from those happening in the rest of the region, not only in terms of motive but also with the perpetrators. DWF head of marine and shipping Jonathan Moss explains that most of the attacks that take place are carried out due to economic reasons.
“Singapore is a very rich island state,” he says. “The vessels docked in Singapore are of considerable volume and weight, and the goods transported are very valuable. I suppose it’s more of a goldmine than other areas in Asia.”
Britanny Damora, a kidnap, ransom and extortion expert at security consultancy Schillings, defines the piracy taking place in the Singapore Strait as “opportunistic and unaffiliated”, because pirate groups in the strait don’t pose a direct challenge to the internal stability of countries.

“Unlike the rebel groups that operate near the coast of Myanmar or in the southern Philippines, most of the piracy in the Singapore Strait is unaffiliated with any sort of armed group,” says Damora.

Another difference is that pirates in the Singapore Strait usually don’t tend to harm crew while in other areas kidnappings are more frequent.

Abu Sayyaf, an Islamist separatist organisation loosely affiliated with ISIS, is one of the groups that has carried out attacks in the Philippines for years. Founded in 1991 to seek independence for the Filipino Muslim minority, Abu Sayyaf uses kidnap for ransom as its modus operandi.

“Three-quarters of the attacks carried out in Singapore were levelled cap 4, meaning that pirates were not armed and no crew on board was harmed,” she adds. “Whereas, in the Philippines, you’re going to see more hostage-taking [situations]. It’s a far more persistent threat because it wants to affect the country’s stability.”

 

Why here, why now?
Even though there has been an increase in attacks, maritime security company ARC COO Max Williams explains that the area has always been affected by a certain amount of crime, with the number of incidents varying each year.

“About five years ago, there was an increase in piracy and hijacking of small tankers with the pirates siphoning off cargo. However, there has nearly always been theft and robbery against all types of vessels in the area,” says Williams.
The reasons for this include the strait’s geographic location, with lots of islands that are difficult to police effectively, high traffic volumes and socio-political factors.

“Piracy is always reflective of social and economic conditions in the area,” he adds.

“So if there is an issue with unemployment or other problems, such as depleted fish stocks, maritime crime can offer a means to earn a living.”

According to Moss, another influencing factor is complacency. “It’s as if this can’t happen in the Singapore Strait, that maritime piracy is an issue for the east coast of Africa, in particular the Gulf of Aden and Somalia,” Moss explains.

“Compared to areas in the African continent that are now familiar with acts of piracy and take steps to avoid it, [in the Singapore Strait] there doesn’t seem to be the know-how or a willingness to engage, [resulting in] a lack of enforcement.”

 

Has Covid-19 had any effect?
Whether the current Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on piracy or not is something experts are still debating. Whilst some believe that coronavirus wasn’t a pull factor, others –  including Damora – think the pandemic had a big role in the increase of attacks.

The re-allocation of resources has indeed been one of the biggest consequences of the pandemic. “This results in a decline of maritime surveillance and cooperation by littoral states,” says Damora. “[The pandemic] has also called a global trade nosedive which increases poverty and encourages more criminal acts, in particular opportunistic ones, at sea.

Another element that the pandemic brought up is the cutting down of crews and safety measures, which made companies operating vessel through the strait more vulnerable to criminals.

“I think that the oversupply of crude oil due to the decline in economic activity is also relevant, as it has pushed many companies to resort to offshore storage and floating tankers due to insufficient storage on land,” she explains. “Low and slow is the ideal target for piracy.”

 

The future of piracy in the strait
Given the current circumstances, experts believe that attacks won’t decrease, leaving crews to pay the price. “Security often takes a back seat to other concerns, but it is the crew members who really suffer from attacks on vessels,” comments Williams.
“Even if there is no confrontation or theft that is not noticed until later, it is, at a minimum, extremely unpleasant to know that someone has been on board the vessel, your home, and stolen your property.”

If the industry wants attacks to decrease, it needs to take clear enforcement measures. Fundamental steps include making sure that an alarm is sounded in the event of an attack, implementing a single entrance/exit policy and carrying out specific threat assessments.

Things will not settle down, says Damora, until the countries that overlook the strait recover from the economic downturn caused by the pandemic. “Until that happens, there’s going to be people looking for jobs and people looking for alternative sources of income and, unfortunately, some of that is criminality at sea.",2020-11-12T11:45:22.575Z,2020-11-12T11:45:22.641Z,

Piracy incidents in the Gulf of Guinea contributed to a total of 132 global attacks in the first nine months of 2020, up from 119 in the prior period, the IMB said in a report Wednesday. Out of 85 sailors taken for ransom around the world, 80 were seized off the coast of Nigeria, Benin, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and Ghana, it said.

Incidents on vessels in West African waters have been rising in recent years, with attacks targeting crew rather than the ship or its cargo. The region has overtaken southeast Asia as the worst area for piracy and kidnappings, driving up insurance premiums for shippers.

Several large fishing ships circle. None of the victims have life jackets, but no one makes a move to help. This isn’t a rescue.

A voice, off camera, shouts in Mandarin: “In the front, to the left! What are you doing?” Then: “Fire! Fire! Fire!”

Bullets spray the water around one flailing man. One round catches him. His body stills. Blood plumes in the blue ocean. Later, deckhands laugh and pose for photos.

Grainy video of the 2012 killings, which shows the systematic slaughter of at least four men in the Indian Ocean, has been circulating in the darker corners of the Internet for more than seven years. Now, authorities in Taiwan have arrested a suspect: a 43-year-old Chinese national whom they believe to be the man who shouted the orders to kill. Investigators hope he leads them to others.

But the case, which is still unfolding, shows the challenge of prosecuting crimes on the high seas. There were at least four tuna longliner ships on the scene of an incident that unfolded over more than 10 minutes in broad daylight. But no law required any of the dozens of witnesses to report the killings — and no one did. Law enforcement in the open ocean is limited, and jurisdiction is complicated. Authorities learned of the killings only when the video turned up on a cellphone left in a taxi in Fiji in 2014.

It’s still unclear who the victims were, or why they were shot. An unknown number of similar killings take place each year — deckhands on the ship from which the video was shot told a private investigator, and later a documentary crew on camera, that they’d witnessed a similar slaughter a week before.

Wang Feng Yu, believed to have been the captain of the Taiwanese-flagged Ping Shin 101 during the attack, was taken into custody by the Taiwanese coast guard in August after his current ship docked at Kaohsiung port. He’s being held while prosecutors investigate.

“Now that we have the captain, we have a more direct way of questioning him about the whole ordeal,” Tseng Ching-ya, spokeswoman for the Kaohsiung District Prosecutor’s Office, told the Central News Agency in Taiwan.

Hsu Hung-ju, the deputy chief prosecutor in Kaohsiung, told The Washington Post that such investigations normally take six to eight months. “It depends on the case,” he said. “But it won’t take too long.”

Hsu declined to say whether prosecutor Hsu Hung-pin had interviewed witnesses. Though he refused to provide a name, Hsu also said that Wang has a lawyer.

The footage, shot from the Ping Shin in what appears to be the aftermath of a wreck, is chilling. One man in the water raises his arms over his head, palms open, in what looks like an attempt to surrender. A bullet drills into the back of his head, knocking him facedown. His body floats, lifeless.

Gunmen with semiautomatic weapons appear to fire at least 40 rounds. “I’ve shot five!” one shouts in Mandarin.
Trygg Mat Tracking, a Norwegian research firm that focuses on maritime crime, identified the Ping Shin 101 by comparing video footage with images in a maritime database. Former deckhands were identified through Facebook and other social media platforms where they had discussed their time onboard. Interviews with these former deckhands, some of whom said they witnessed the killings captured in the video, revealed the name of the captain and details of the incident.

Officials from the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, which licenses commercial fishing in the region where the killings occurred, and the Taiwanese flag registry, which is responsible for enforcing laws on Taiwanese-flagged ships, declined to provide information about the crew, the captains at the scene, the ships’ routes or their recent ports of call.

Taiwanese officials, presented with the names of the men and ships in 2015 and 2016, said the victims appeared to be part of a failed pirate attack. Tzu-yaw Tsay, then the director of the Taiwanese fisheries agency, questioned whether the killings were murder. “We don’t know what happened,” Tsay said at the time. “So there’s no way for us to say whether it’s legal.”

But maritime security analysts caution that the claim of piracy has been used to justify attacks for a range of alleged offenses, real or otherwise. The victims, they say, might have been crew members who had mutinied, thieves caught stealing or simply rival fishermen.

“It is nearly impossible to police the open ocean, and sometimes people take matters into their own hands, as was the case here,” said Klaus Luhta, vice president of the International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots, a seafarers union. He noted that the men appeared to be unarmed and defenseless, and not to pose a threat.

“Whether this was some sort of vigilante justice or cold-blooded killing for reasons unknown,” he said, “we see clearly it is a vicious murder at sea.”

Such killings will continue to go unchecked, Luhta said, without better tracking of offshore violence, more transparency from flag registries and fishing companies, and more effort by governments to prosecute the perpetrators.

Prosecuting such crimes matters, U.S. Naval Academy historian Claude Berube said, because what occurs at sea affects everyone. By some estimates, 90 percent of world trade is moved by sea; seafood is a major source of protein for much of the world.

If dumping oil intentionally, fishing in prohibited waters, enslaving deckhands or killing on camera go unpunished, Berube said, ship operators who are willing to break the law gain a competitive advantage. He said lawlessness at sea makes consumers complicit in human rights and environmental abuses.

“The public should be concerned with crimes at sea because those crimes don’t start or stop at sea,” Berube said. “They have land-based networks that affect lives and economies.”

But lawbreaking can be countered only when it’s reported, that rarely happens offshore. Shipping and fishing companies, maritime insurers, private security firms, embassies and flag registries track violence at sea to varying degrees, but there’s no single comprehensive centralized or public database.

The Stable Seas program of the Colorado-based One Earth Future Foundation has been granted access to much of that information. Former U.S. Navy officer Jon Huggins, a senior adviser to the program, says the data includes a variety of crimes: robbers siphoning fuel, hijackings, human trafficking, piracy.

When program officials tried to convince the groups that gathered the data to make it available to the public, Huggins said, they pushed back. Risk management companies asked why they should share data they could sell instead. Coastal states worried it might scare away business. Flag registries were reluctant to release information that might oblige them to act, which they had little motivation or ability to do.

Complaints of crime at sea are rare. Berube lists the reasons: Many ships lack the insurance that would make reporting worthwhile. Captains resist prying investigations that can cause delays. Most countries lack blue-water navies or coast guards that patrol beyond their territorial limits; they have neither the financial ability to patrol international waters of uncertain jurisdiction, nor much interest in doing so.

“We saw those challenges with Somali piracy a decade ago,” Berube said. “Merchant ships were largely told that they were on their own, and they took on private security teams in the absence of national or international support.”

Nonetheless, much has been learned about the 2012 killings. Two Filipino deckhands on the Ping Shin 101 named Aldrin and Maximo — they shared only one name — told a private investigator on camera that they witnessed the killings. In the video of the incident, Maximo can be seen smiling and posing for selfies after the shooting. He wears an oversize blue T-shirt that reads “Hang 10.” A deckhand on the Chun I 628, another ship at the scene, also described the incident.
The Ping Shin was fishing in the Indian Ocean somewhere between Somalia and Seychelles in August 2012, Aldrin and Maximo told private investigator Karsten Von Hoesslin in videotaped interviews, when it received a radio alert that a nearby ship had come under attack by pirates. It was unclear which ship was being attacked; there was yelling back and forth, the witnesses said. The supposed pirates seemed to be unarmed.

Deckhands aboard the Ping Shin 101 opened fire, and the men in the smaller boat leaped into the water. Some began yelling that they were not a threat. “No Somali!” one deckhand heard them say. “No pirates!”

Wang was the captain of the Ping Shin 101. He was in his 30s, young for a captain. He had a dragon tattoo on his left arm. Deckhands called him “Captain Hoodlum.”

“He was a rough guy,” one told Von Hoesslin, director of a security company called the Remote Operations Agency. “He hits people.”

Aldrin said Wang had a ferocious temper: “He punched, then kicked, if you did a mistake.”

According to ship tracking records, the 165-foot Ping Shin 101 was owned by a Shanghai business executive named Lee Chao Ping, principal of the Ping Shin Fishery Co. Ltd. in Kaohsiung. Efforts to reach Lee were unsuccessful. Online records show that the business closed in 2018. A security guard at its former address said in September that there was a Ping Shin or Ping Hsin fishery in the building some years ago but that the office had since closed.

Interpol and a private investigation firm that specializes in maritime crime have also been unable to find Lee.

Duncan Kawino, who said he worked on the Ping Shin 101 when it docked in Mombasa, Kenya, in 2013, said it fished mostly in Somali waters, but reported that its catch came from Seychelles waters, where he said it had a license. The Ping Shin 101 and the Chun I 628 had three armed guards each, all Pakistani, the witnesses said. The video shows at least four men being killed, but Aldrin and Maximo said it’s likely that more were shot — possibly 10 to 15.

The witnesses said the victims probably weren’t pirates. “They didn’t have any guns, only fishing equipment on their boat,” Maximo said. “It was wrong, people getting shot. But there was nothing I could do about it.”

Nor was it an isolated incident: A similar confrontation occurred a week earlier, Aldrin said. The circumstances he described on camera for a documentary series were virtually the same: Alleged pirates were rammed, shot and killed, their bodies left floating in the water. A video that apparently captured the earlier attack was discovered by Trygg Mat Tracking, the Norwegian research firm.

The Ping Shin 101 eventually ended up on the ocean floor. The vessel sank on July 7, 2014, less than two years after the shootings captured on the video. Wang, still the captain, broadcast a distress signal citing a mechanical failure. “Something exploded,” one crew member said on camera.

Taiwanese authorities issued an arrest warrant for Wang in December 2018. In August, prosecutors got their break. A tuna longliner called the Indian Star, owned by a Taiwanese company and flagged to Seychelles, arrived in Kaohsiung. The fishing ship had a history of violations, including using forged licenses and fishing in forbidden areas. More important to authorities, though, was the man who captained the vessel. Wang Feng Yu stepped ashore, and was arrested.",2020-11-12T11:53:30.637Z,2020-11-12T11:53:30.677Z,

Violent extremist groups operating in East Africa such as al-Shabaab, Ansar al-Sunna and the Islamic State in East Africa Somalia (IS-Somalia) are increasingly making use of gaps in maritime security. Counter-terrorism strategies must target this aspect of their operations to stop extremists exploiting Africa's coasts through attacks, smuggling and extortion.

Terror groups fund a portion of their activities through maritime smuggling that involves drugs, arms and human trafficking. Many violent extremists also exploit resources like sugar, cereals and textiles. Al-Shabaab has been involved in charcoal smuggling since 2011. The group earns an estimated US$7 million a year through maritime crime – enough to ensure its long-term survival and to fund its land-based terror attacks.

Al-Shabaab has also raised income through the extortion and illicit taxation of the Port of Mogadishu and associated independent businesses. For example, al-Shabaab obtains shipping manifests that allow it to charge businesses, under threat of violence, US$100 for each 20-foot container and US$160 for 40-foot containers.

Another group operating in the Somali and Tanzanian coastal areas is IS-Somalia. Although less active than al-Shabaab, IS-Somalia repeatedly exploits weak maritime awareness for its activities. Within a year of its founding, IS-Somalia occupied and controlled the northern port town of Qandala.

This gave the group access to a plethora of resources from its affiliate, IS-Yemen. These resources included weapons and fighters, and allowed for experienced trainers to teach IS-Somalia recruits some of the tactics and skills developed during the Yemen conflict.

Although forced from Qandala after only a month, IS-Somalia has continued to import weapons and fighters from IS-Yemen, mostly through smuggling networks and agreements with locals. The small ports and landing sites that dot the coast of Somalia – only a few hours by boat from Yemen – allow for continued access to these resources. This has been instrumental for IS-Somalia's development and entrenchment.

Attacks in Cabo Delgado province on Mozambique's north east coast, increased in intensity in 2020. The group responsible, Ansar al-Sunna, has used the coastline to disrupt government forces. The insurgents have targeted Mocimboa da Praia, a small but significant town (due to its wealth in natural resources) in northern Cabo Delgado. In March militants simultaneously attacked from land and sea, overwhelming security forces and allowing the group to occupy the port for several hours.

Government attempts to liberate the port have been unsuccessful and it remains partially under the insurgents' control. Since then, the group has launched multiple attacks on military bases and refugee camps using maritime approaches .

Millions of dollars have been spent by governments and international organisations like the United Nations (UN) on curbing terrorism, especially in Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania and Mozambique. The African Union Mission in Somalia, despite possessing a maritime component, hasn't developed any real expertise or consistency in this area.

The Southern African Development Community (SADC) also has counter-terrorism activities in the region. But most operations are focused inland, and the illicit and violent extremism activities on the coast are generally dealt with by agencies that fight piracy.

Willem Els, Senior Training Coordinator at the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), says that maritime police (and coast guards where they exist) focus more on piracy than organised crime or terrorism along the East African coast. While some piracy is conducted by violent extremist groups, most can be attributed to criminal networks. But maritime police often overlook illicit human smuggling and arms trading at the ports.

Al-Shabaab and al-Sunna's mobility is far-reaching and they use the sea to move goods and people and to execute attacks. But their activities often fall beyond the jurisdiction of counter-terrorism operations. At times, these operations lack a mandate to act on 'robbery at sea' incidents carried out by violent extremist groups on Africa's east coast.

Timothy Walker, Maritime Project Leader at the ISS, says some maritime counter-piracy operations could also focus on preventing terrorism within the national waters of participating states. For example Operation Prosperity in the Gulf of Guinea, and Operation Copper , in which South African naval forces are deployed in Mozambique's territorial waters.

Mandates and deployments of coast guards and other maritime enforcement agencies differ, so creating a regional approach aimed at terrorists might be difficult. Not only do extremist groups operate across maritime borders, but many of their activities intersect land and sea, making establishing jurisdiction tricky.

Walker says agencies like the UN Office on Drugs and Crime and the International Maritime Organisation give training to enhance state capabilities across a range of crimes, as do the United States and other governments. But political will to act and cooperate with neighbouring states is vital.

Counter-terrorism efforts against the three violent extremist groups operating on Africa's East Coast have continued for years with varying degrees of success. None have considered the importance of the oceans for the long-term survival of these groups. Strategies to prevent terrorism must include maritime elements that close off the financial and operational activities on which these groups rely.",2020-11-12T11:54:49.463Z,2020-11-12T11:54:49.512Z,

The findings by Geneva-based research group, the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime, could further complicate attempts by Somali transfer companies to retain access to international banking services.

Though they provide a lifeline to millions in the anarchic nation, few banks will do business with them because of the risk of falling foul of international transparency and anti-money laundering regulations.

Asked about the report, the Central Bank of Somalia, which regulates money transfer firms, said it was unaware of the transfers but would investigate and was, in general, making progress in countering terrorism financing.

When contacted, the four companies each said they did their best to comply with global “know your customer” norms despite Somalia having no national ID card. The firms also said they maintain databases of internationally sanctioned individuals.

The global initiative analysed nearly six years of transaction records from the city of Bossasso, matching them with mobile phone records provided by security sources and database searches.

The report identified 176 transactions from the past six years that it said appeared to be linked to suspected weapons dealers in Somalia and Yemen. Nearly two thirds were over the $10,000 threshold that should trigger an automatic report to regulatory authorities.

They include two transfers totalling nearly $40,000 to numbers linked to Sayf Abdulrab Salem al-Hayashi after the US treasury sanctioned him in 2017 for allegedly providing weapons and financial support to Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and Islamic State in Yemen, the report said.

Al-Hayashi could not be reached for comment.

Somalia-based Amal Express and Iftin Express handled the transactions, which used different combinations of his name and nickname, the report said. Amal Express said a transfer slip shown in the report and allegedly linked to Al-Hayashi was a forgery. Iftin Express said the transaction slip was a fake and added that it reported all transactions over $10,000 to Somali authorities.

Multiple identities

The report did not find any instances where the other two companies, Dahabshiil and Taaj, made transfers to any sanctioned individuals, but it noted instances where individuals were able to make transfers with them using multiple names and numbers, a violation of Somali law.

One man used 24 names between the four companies, the report said. All four companies said they did not allow customers to use multiple identities or phone numbers. Dahabshiil also said it has stopped doing transfers between Somalia and Yemen.

The companies did not say whether the six men named in the report are in their databases.

Apart from Al-Hayashi — the only one under US sanctions — three others whose names appear in the suspect transactions were identified as suspected arms dealers in public reports by the UN panel of experts on Somalia.

Two were flagged — one as a proxy for Al-Hayashi, and one as an arms trafficker — in a confidential annex to a 2018 report by the same panel.

Few Somalis have bank accounts. Money transfer companies — often known as hawalas — are vital to economic activity and delivering humanitarian aid.

Cutting companies off from banking is not the answer, said the report’s author, Jay Bahadur, former head of the UN panel of experts. “Excluding companies from international banking services will punish families that rely on them and drive financial flows underground.” 

But he said companies must ensure their agents follow anti-money laundering laws and Somali authorities must improve enforcement.

“Financial regulatory bodies in Somalia are understaffed, under-resourced, and aren’t trusted by domestic financial institutions,” he said. “They receive limited reporting data and aren’t able to take much action with what they do receive.”

Abdirahman M Abdullahi, governor of Somalia’s central bank, said co-operation is improving. Somalia is working with the World Bank on developing a national ID card, he said.

He said arrests have been made for breaking anti-money laundering and terrorism financing law, citing the case of a trader convicted in August of running an unregistered bank.

Drugs were not the only items seized. Animal skin, live reptiles and elephant tusks were part of the confiscated products.

It also involved police, customs, environment, wildlife and forestry agencies from 111 countries.

77,https://thearabweekly.com/qataris-sign-security-deal-gna-challenging-un-efforts-libya,"Qataris sign security deal with GNA, challenging UN efforts in Libya","DOHA – Turkey and Qatar are moving in Libya in a way that suggests they share a plan to obstruct the settlement path led by the US State Department, in a step that reflects an anticipation of and a challenge to the US obtaining full control of the Libyan file in the post-presidential election phase.

In the time period in which the US administration is almost paralysed, whether President Donald Trump wins or loses his bid for a second term in the White House, the Qataris have moved to return to the Libyan scene after years of hiding behind Turkey’s role there, which is expected to shrink in the coming period.

In a move considered by experts to be a clear violation of the recent inter-Libyan military agreement, Fathi Bashagha, interior minister of the Government of National Accord (GNA), signed a memorandum of understanding on security cooperation with the Qatari Prime Minister and Interior Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa bin Abdulaziz al-Thani on Monday.

According to analysts, the step reflects a challenge to the United Nations and United States' efforts to reach a settlement that ends the division in Libya, as well as rejection of the military agreement.

The first article of the memorandum states that it focuses on “cooperation in the field of combating terrorism and organised crime through exchange of information about terrorist organisations and the operational terrorist support networks in terms of supply, funding, research and investigation; helping in identification of individuals and assisting in investigations; and sharing data and expertise on the technical means that contribute to preventing and combating terrorism, provided that the two parties make available to each other the necessary tools that help in combating various forms of international criminality.”

The memorandum also provides for the “formation of a joint security follow-up committee that includes representatives from the concerned departments of the two parties, to follow up on security issues of common concern.”

The signing of the memorandum of understanding coincided with the publication of a statement by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo welcoming the declaration of a permanent ceasefire in all of Libya.

On Monday, Pompeo said that a ceasefire agreement between Libya’s warring factions was a “courageous step” and that all foreign fighters must leave the country in 90 days in line with the terms of the accord.

Pompeo, who arrived in New Delhi on the first leg of his Asian tour, said it was important that all parties support the success of the UN-facilitated talks in Geneva.

“We commend Libyan leadership on all sides for taking this courageous step,” he said in a statement.

Pompeo's statements are seen as a warning to all intervening parties in Libya against obstructing the settlement process, but analysts do not overstate the importance of these warnings in light of the continued silence of the White House, which is currently preoccupied with presidential elections coming up on November 3.

These analysts see Turkish-Qatari coordination aimed at  having Doha replace Ankara in the Libyan file, as Ankara stands to be among the parties likely to be pushed out of the Libyan scene in the coming period. This was basically the plan that Qatari Defence Minister Khaled al-Attiyah's visit to Tripoli in August was meant to pave the way for.

Washington is expected to take full control of the Libyan file following presidential elections, regardless of who wins. The Qatari and Turkish moves seem to reflect the fact that the two allies are betting on a Biden victory, which is why they are trying to block any agreement that does not guarantee absolute control over power in Libya to their Islamist allies there.

US involvement in the Libyan file has intensified since the appointment of Ambassador Richard Norland in August of last year. Norland is leading diplomatic efforts aimed mainly at curtailing Russian influence in Libya, amid US accusations that Moscow has deployed mercenaries from the Wagner group and supplied weapons to the Libyan National Army (LNA) led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar. In addition to Norland, the US State Department is counting on US diplomat and acting head of the UN Mission in Libya Stephanie Williams.

The Turkish and Qatari moves heighten concerns about the fragility of the Libyan agreement, especially with Ankara’s continued sending of weapons to Libya days before the signing of the agreement, in addition to tweets by the Turkish defence ministry stating that it continues to train the GNA-backed militias as part of the military agreement signed last November, which represents a clear violation of the terms of the recent inter-Libyan ceasefire agreement.

The second article of the permanent ceasefire agreement, signed in Geneva on Friday, stipulates “the freezing of all military agreements related to training inside Libya and the departure of the foreign training crews, until the unified government takes over its duties and directs the security operations room,to be formed under the terms of this agreement, to propose and implement special security arrangements that will ensure the security of the areas vacated by the military units and armed formations.”",2020-11-12T11:57:00.216Z,2020-11-12T11:57:00.299Z,

Confidential Information obtained by the Investigative Reporting Project Italy (IRPI) and shared with Times of Malta as part of the Daphne Project, indicates that Robert a nd Adrian Agius are connected to Italian, Libyan, Romanian and even Albanian organised crime groups. 

The confidential information indicates that the Agius brothers have both been subjects of law enforcement investigations throughout Europe.
The brothers are believed to have been involved in major cigarette smuggling, cooperating with different organised crime groups throughout Europe. 

Links have been established between the Agius brothers and an organised crime group largely linked to cigarette smuggling from Libya via Malta to the UK.

Meanwhile, IRPI have established that known associates of the Agius brothers travelled to the Sicilian port of Catania repeatedly between 2012 and 2017. 

In a sting operation code named ‘Zeta’, Sicilian police identified Jamie Vella, who was arrested along with the Agius brothers and a number of other suspects in connection with Daphne Caruana Galizia's murder back in 2017.  

Associates charged with Mafia-style activities

Sources in the Sicilian police confirmed that Vella was not formally investigated there, but his Italian associates were eventually charged with Mafia-style activities including extortion. 

One such associate had previously been charged over murder and illegal possession of explosive materials.  

Sources also indicated that the Agius brothers have had other dealings with Italian mafia groups. 

Intelligence has linked them to other Italians who run the logistical side of an arms trafficking operation between Europe and Africa.  

In 2015, the Italian Carabinieri received information about illegal arms trafficking involving a top gun in the powerful Santapaola Mafia clan that runs many of Sicily’s ports. 

Using third parties as proxies, the man purchased deactivated weapons from a Slovak arms manufacturer. The weapons, sources said, can easily be reactivated by removing a metal lock placed on the firing mechanism. Once re-activated, the criminals would ship the rifles to Malta via courier services, with intelligence indicating they were destined to be moved on further south to Africa. 

Reactivated weapons originating from the same producer have been tied to a number of terror attacks in Europe in recent years.  

Italian investigators estimate that in one year alone this group shipped around 160 weapons across Europe.",2020-11-12T11:57:58.192Z,2020-11-12T11:57:58.236Z,

Counternarcotics prosecutors said they had tracked the transatlantic journey of 11.5-tons of cocaine from Guyana, on the northeastern coast of South America, and seized it upon its arrival at the Port of Antwerp.

The catch is “the largest overseas drug bust ever, worldwide,” federal prosecutors told Belgian media, estimating the street value of the drug load at €900 million.
The massive load of cocaine left a port in Guyana on late October and prosecutors were able to track following the dismantlement of a drug trafficking gang led by a former Belgian counternarcotics chief which revealed the existence of tight-knit links between criminal gangs and counternarcotics and law enforcement officials.

Three police officers, a port manager and a lawyer were among some 20 other criminals arrested as part of the operation targeting the “well-structured” criminal organisation suspected of orchestrating large and “regular” drug shipments from South America to Belgium.

The record-breaking shipment was expected by law enforcement officials as it is suspected it left the port of Guyana after the drug gang’s arrest in Belgium, with drug gangs unable to intercept it once at sea, De Standaard reports.

It was disguised as scrap metal and placed inside a steel container which was in turn packed into a sea container and loaded into a transatlantic vessel.

The dismantlement of the drug gang in late September led to the arrest and indictment of 22 people, with three people still in the Netherlands awaiting extradition.

The large shipment was intercepted by a joint Australian Federal Police-Australian Border Force operation when it came into Sydney in September, following a tip from US Homeland Security about the suspicious cargo.
The cocaine, with an estimated street value of up to $248 million, was hidden inside 275 boxes of banana pulp in a larger shipment of almost 2000 boxes of fruit pulp.

AFP investigators removed the cocaine and reconstructed the shipment, sending it onwards in October to its planned delivery address, a storage facility in south-west Sydney.

Mark Rene De Hesselle, 68, was subsequently arrested at his home in Forestville on Friday morning.

Police will allege Mr De Hesselle collected 139 boxes of the banana pulp in the two weeks after the package was delivered, searching through the bags for the cocaine.
During the operation, officers seized mobile phones, a laptop, bags of banana pulp, a case of green stones suspected to be emeralds, and five one-kilogram silver ingots.

The man has been charged with attempting to import a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug and attempting to possess a commercial quantity of unlawfully imported border controlled drugs. The offences carry maximum penalties of life in prison.
He appeared in Sydney Central Local Court on Friday afternoon. He did not apply for bail and it was formally refused.

AFP Detective Superintendent Geoffrey Turner said organised crime groups were taking bigger risks to move drugs during global COVID-19 lockdowns.

""They think that choosing everyday items such as fruit would be innocuous enough to thwart law enforcement detection,"" Detective Superintendent Turner said.

""To people who think cocaine may be harmless and part of the party scene, remember this – it is a powerful, addictive stimulant, that makes its way to Australia through a chain of violence and exploitation, and every time you use it only fuels this destruction, and line the pockets of organised crime.""

Garry Low, ABF Superintendent Regional Investigations NSW, said officers were working every day to detect and disrupt attempts to import drugs into Australia.

""My message to anyone thinking of engaging in this type of activity is to reconsider. Our wide range of detection methodologies can pick up a concealment, however well-hidden criminals believe it is – and inside frozen fruit is no exception,"" he said.

NSW Health issued a separate warning on Friday to cocaine and ketamine users about a recent spate of overdoses thought to be linked to the opioid fentanyl.

Fentanyl and the related opioid acetylfentanyl were identified as the likely and ""virtually indistinguishable"" adulterants in batches of cocaine and ketamine that had led to overdoses.

""We’ve seen several people recently where acetylfentanyl was taken unknowingly and was associated with serious harm. The side effects of acetylfentanyl include drowsiness, loss of consciousness and slowed breathing, and when taken unknowingly can cause life-threatening effects,"" the NSW Poisons Information Centre's Professor Andrew Dawson said.",2020-11-12T12:02:37.768Z,2020-11-12T12:02:37.824Z,

President Andrés Manuel López Obrador announced during his daily press briefing Tuesday that the military arrested one of the two pilots after they abandoned the aircraft at Chetumal International Airport in Chetumal, Quintana Roo. 

The suspect's identity was not revealed to the press.

López Obrador said that despite the seizure of the jet approximately at 1am local time Tuesday, two other aircrafts that were also detected in Mexican airspace were out of the armed force's reach.  

The massive shipment is worth approximately $72 million in the United States. It's unknown where the jet had previously departed from.
'This was a job of the Army, of the Secretary of Defense. There was a pursuit of three planes that entered the national territory, through Quintana Roo,' the Mexican president said. 'Two left and one landed at the Chetumal airport and investigations have already begun.'

Unknown armed men kidnapped those people a few days ago upon their arrival to Tripoli’s Mitiga Airport, coming from Benghazi.

The Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) condemned the incident on Friday and denied any affiliation with the perpetrators.

Since the 2011 civil war that toppled the regime of late dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Tripoli descended into chaos and became dominated by lawless militias as GNA remains paralyzed to enforce security and the rule of law.

The UN Mission, who referred to the kidnapping as “arbitrary arrest”, said on Twitter that “at least one person was followed to his destination in Tripoli and then arrested, others were allegedly arrested at the airport upon arrival.”

“UNSMIL reiterates that all Libyan citizens have the right to freedom of movement,” the Mission said before adding, “any illegal infringement of this right is a serious violation of Libya’s obligations under international law.”

A few days ago, rivals from west and east of country agreed during a UN-sponsored dialogue in Ghadames to allow cross-city movement  between the two regions. Thus, the kidnapping of those Libyans in Tripoli would constitute the first violation of the Ghadames agreement.

The lawmakers met in the coastal town of Bouznika, south of Morocco's capital Rabat, for talks that come ahead of a major meeting in Tunisia slated for November 9.

The talks follow a ""permanent"" UN-backed ceasefire agreement signed in Switzerland last month, intended to pave the way towards a political solution to the country's grinding conflict.

Libya, with Africa's largest proven crude oil reserves, has been wracked by conflict for nearly a decade, since the overthrow and killing of dictator Moamer Kadhafi in a NATO-backed uprising in 2011.

It has since been dominated by armed groups and divided between two administrations that have been bitterly-opposed: the UN-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in the capital Tripoli, and a rival administration in the east backed by military strongman Khalifa Haftar.

Warring factions returned to the negotiating table in September in UN-supported talks, with negotiations being held in Morocco, Egypt and Switzerland.

Details of the agenda of the talks in Morocco have not been released.

Negotiators are pushing parallel efforts to broker peace, with the military section of talks taking place this week for the fist time on Libyan soil.

On Tuesday, former enemy officers sat together in a joint military commission and agreed on a road map for implementing the ceasefire deal.",2020-11-12T12:24:16.202Z,2020-11-12T12:24:16.227Z,

Delegates wearing masks stood before signing the agreement in Geneva with the aim to end conflict that has wracked Libya since dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011 in a NATO-backed uprising.

The ""talks in Geneva today culminate in a historic achievement as Libyan teams reach a permanent ceasefire agreement across Libya"", the UN's Libya mission said.

""This achievement is an important turning point towards peace and stability in Libya,"" according its Facebook page, which showed a live stream of the signing ceremony at the UN Palais des Nations.

The UN said the deal takes effect immediately.

Stephanie Williams, the UN's envoy to the troubled North African country, said it was ""a moment that will go down in history"".

""You have met for the sake of Libya, for your people in order to take concrete steps to put an end to their suffering,"" she said at the signing ceremony.

""Nobody can love Libya as much as you do,"" said Williams, who heads the UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL).

""The road was long and difficult at times. Your patriotism was your way forward and you were able to reach a ceasefire agreement.
""I hope that this agreement will help put an end to the suffering of the Libyan people and we hope it will allow the displaced and refugees inside and outside the country to return to their homes and to live in peace and safety.""

Libya has been wracked by nearly a decade of conflict.

'Crucial sign for Libya'

Rival power centres and a myriad of militias are vying for control, human rights violations have been rampant, and traffickers are using the chaos to smuggle desperate migrants on dangerous sea journeys to Europe.

The capital Tripoli in the west is held by the internationally recognised Government of National Accord, while a parliament based in the eastern city of Tobruk is backed by forces led by military commander Khalifa Haftar.

Haftar - supported by Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt - launched an offensive on Tripoli in April 2019 but was pushed back early this year as pro-GNA forces received crucial support from Turkey.

Fighting has since stalled around the central coastal city of Sirte, the late Gaddafi's hometown.

On Tuesday, the second day of the talks, Williams said that Libya's rival factions had agreed to maintain a lull in fighting and open internal land and air routes.

""What you have accomplished here is a crucial sign for Libya and the Libyan people,"" Williams said Friday.

""I am hopeful that future generations of Libyans will consider today's agreement as a first, critical, courageous step to achieve a comprehensive settlement of the Libyan crisis, that has gone on for too long.""

She said there was a lot of work ahead in the coming weeks in order to implement the commitments but it was essential to do so as quickly as possible.",2020-11-12T12:26:07.337Z,2020-11-12T12:26:07.355Z,
93,https://globalriskinsights.com/2020/10/libya-the-impacts-of-the-ceasefire-on-libyan-politics/,Libya – The Impacts of the Ceasefire on Libyan Politics,"On 21 August 2020, the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) based in Tripoli and its rival administration controlling Eastern Libya announced their commitment to a ceasefire and to finding a political solution to the conflict that has ravaged the country since 2011. So far, the truce has been successful in preventing further violence. However, it has opened the door to political infighting within both parties which could compromise the overall inter-Libyan dialogue. 

A lasting ceasefire 
As of early October, the ceasefire agreement signed by the GNA and the administration affiliated to the Libyan National Army on 21 August has been largely successful, despite incidents involving pro-Haftar militias in Sirte. This truce definitely constitutes a step forward since it was, for once, willingly coordinated by the two rival parties rather than unilaterally declared or imposed by external actors. 

Beyond interrupting the bloodshed, the ceasefire has also enabled a constructive political dialogue. During a round of consultations held in Montreux, Switzerland, on 7-9 September, key Libyan stakeholders and members of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) agreed on a road map for a comprehensive political solution to the conflict. This includes holding new presidential and parliamentary elections within 18 months. In parallel, members of the GNA and the House of Representatives based in Tobruk held talks in Morocco and reached an agreement on criteria regarding the allocation of key positions in Libyan institutions. 

Last but not least, as a result of the truce and the lifting of the blockade imposed since January by the LNA, the country’s oil production is on the rise and exports are set to restart. 

Redistribution of power and internal struggles 
An unexpected side effect of the ceasefire has been to redistribute power within the Western and Eastern governments, fuelling  political infighting. 

On the GNA’s side, tensions emerged rapidly due to corruption allegations, financial integrity issues and militias. Following large popular demonstrations denouncing  corruption and poor services in the west of the country, the GNA’s Prime Minister, Fayez al-Sarraj, briefly suspended his  Interior Minister, Fathi Bashagha, because the latter supported the protesters. Sarraj’s announcement on 16 September that he would resign by the end of the following month fragmented the GNA further. Internal rivalries were truly exposed in broad light as three contenders started competing to replace him: Bashagha, Ahmed Maiteeq – Vice President of the GNA– and Khalid al-Mishri – Chairman of the High Council of State. 

In the eastern part of the country, the power shift is more subtle, but its consequences are equally significant. Khalifa Haftar, the head of the LNA, appears to be on a descending trajectory while Aguila Saleh, President of the House of Representatives in Tobruk, is on his way to become the new figurehead of the eastern bloc. Haftar had already suffered a blow in June, as his 14-month offensive on Tripoli was pushed back. The ceasefire further reduced Haftar’s power and enabled Saleh’s rise in two ways. First, Saleh was the one to sign the ceasefire agreement on behalf of the eastern administration, alongside Sarraj. Then, the ceasefire provoked a shift in the conflict dynamics from military action to political dialogue. In this new context, Saleh is more suitable, as a politician, to take the lead on what is coming next. The EU’s decision to drop sanctions against him also clears his path to power, since it signals that he is now an acceptable interlocutor in the peace process. 

As a result of the ceasefire, both coalitions are thus highly unstable due to internal power shifts. 

What’s next for Libya? 
Although the situation in Libya is moving away from open hostilities and towards a political process, the situation remains uncertain. 

First of all, the outcome of the GNA’s internal power struggle has the potential to facilitate or negatively impact the inter-Libyan dialogue. The process is most likely to lead to a promising outcome if either Maiteeq or Mishri were appointed to replace Sarraj. Indeed, the two men have managed to maintain ties not only with Turkey, the GNA’s main international ally, but also with Russia, which supports the LNA. Moreover, Maiteeq negotiated the end of the LNA-imposed oil blockade directly with Haftar’s son in Moscow, while Mishri declared in early September that he was ready to meet with Haftar himself. As a result, the political dialogue between Tripoli and the eastern bloc is most likely to succeed if one of them becomes the head of the GNA. On the contrary, a return to violence is possible if Bashagha lands the position. The GNA’s Interior Minister is indeed known for his preference for military options and his power base is largely constituted of militias from Misrata. However, this could only happen with Turkey’s consent. . 

It is also worth noting that Sarraj made his resignation conditional upon an agreement over a new government being negotiated before the end of October. Without one, it is highly likely that he will stay in power. If he does, the process will benefit from leadership continuity on the GNA’s side and from Sarraj’s reputation as an acceptable interlocutor among some eastern factions, their foreign allies and other international players. 

Finally, the current multiplication of negotiation platforms between the two sides is likely to compromise the overall inter-Libyan dialogue. Indeed, consultations and conferences led by different foreign or Libyan actors every time have recently been held in Switzerland, Morocco, Egypt and Germany. While it signals a willingness to find a political solution, this further reinforces internal power struggles and confuses the dialogue between the warring sides. 

Despite those concerns, the permanent and countrywide cease-fire signed by the GNA and the LNA on 23 October seems to indicate that Libya is on the right track to reach a full peace deal. ",2020-11-12T12:28:39.240Z,2020-11-12T12:28:39.267Z,

Судно строится в рамках инвестпрограммы «квоты под киль» для рыбодобывающей компании «Глобус». О том, как проходил спуск, читайте в оперативном репортаже нашего специального корреспондента Кирилла Воловика.

Немного о «Марлине»

Ярусолов проекта MT1112XL был заложен на «Северной верфи» 14 сентября 2018 года. Разработчиком проекта выступает норвежское конструкторское бюро Marin Teknikk AS. Рабоче-конструкторскую, а также эксплуатационную, плазово-технологическую и приемосдаточную документации прорабатывали конструктора «Северной верфи». Вообще это не первый ярусолов, который спущен на воду силами корабелов верфи - всего в серии будет три подобных судна – два из них строятся для компании ""Вирма"" и одно для компании ""Глобус"".

Как отмечают заводчане и сами эксплуатанты, подобные рыболовецкие суда предназначены для высокотехнологичного и экологического лова рыбы. На серии ярусоловах проекта MT1112XL предусмотрены автоматизированные линии установки и выборки ярусов, оборудование для глубокой и безотходной переработки и хранения улова на самом «рыбаке».

«Марлин» будет вести промысел в Норвежском и Баренцевом морях, целясь в основном на добычу пикши. 

«Прекрасный подарок на день рождения завода!»

В церемонии спуска на воду ярусолова приняли участие губернатор Санкт-Петербурга Александр Беглов, глава Росрыболовства Илья Шестаков, губернатор Архангельской области Александр Цыбульский, генеральный директор компании «Глобус» Андрей Заика и генеральный директор «Северной верфи» Игорь Орлов.

Торжественную часть открыл Александр Беглов: «Прежде всего я хотел бы поздравить заводчан с наступающим праздником – днем рождения завода, которую буквально через несколько дней исполнится 108 лет. И так получается, что такой хороший подарок как спуск судна выпал в канун дня рождения предприятия. «Северная верфь» всегда была надежным заводом. Это уже третье судно, которое корабелы изготавливают для нашей страны, а впереди еще очень много заказов. Уже 10 «рыбаков» находится в производстве. Я радуюсь, что федеральное правительство и субъекты РФ доверяют нашим судостроителям. Для нас это важно, потому что это обеспечение рабочими местами. Большое всем спасибо, что своим трудом доказываете, что Санкт-Петербург является столицей судостроения!»
Затем слово взял Александр Цыбульский: «Я хочу поблагодарить судостроителей, что в нашем регионе появится новое современное судно, потому что это крайне важно для нас. Сегодня вообще идет серьезный тренд на обновление флота. И для потребителей это возможность получать качественную продукцию на прилавках магазинов. Уверен, что для Архангельской области это большое событие, так как с этого начинается приобретение новых рыболовецких компетенций у наших рыбаков».
Следующим выступил Илья Шестаков: «Прежде всего хочу всех поздравить со спуском на воду очередного рыбопромыслового судна. Вы знаете, что программа по мощнейщему обновлению рыболовецкого флота стала возможной благодаря решению президента России, и был издан и подписан закон о квотах в обмен на инвестиции. Благодаря программе сейчас строится на верфях России 53 рыболовецких судов. Нас пугали, что у наших судостроителей нет компетенций для строительства такого флота, но мы видим, что суда спускаются на воду, суда передаются заказчикам. Вы показали всем своим трудом, что все возможно!».
Потом с поздравительной речью выступил Андрей Заика: «Когда мы закладывали «Марлин», его будущий капитан расчувствовался и сказал, что закладка киля – это как рождение ребенка. Сейчас мы отправляем судно «в школу», а детство у нашего «мальчика» выдалось непростое, мы столкнулись со многими трудностями, которые благополучно преодолели. Я надеюсь, что в следующем году «Марлин» отправится в плавание, и этим судном мы все будем гордиться!».
Завершал официальную часть Игорь Орлов: «Сегодня прекрасный день, поскольку мы все вместе делаем себе, в канун 108-й годовщины, подарок – спуском на воду судна, которое, безусловно, продолжит прославлять коллектив «Северной верфи» на просторах Мирового океана. «Марлин» действительно является очередным прорывом и шагом в рыбной ловле. Заказчик сказал: «Все не просто», но все трудности мы преодолели!»
Крестной матерью ярусолова «Марлин» стала глава муниципального образования «Приморский муниципальный район» Архангельской области Валентина Рудкина.

Слово заказчику

После официальной церемонии спуска генеральный директор компании «Глобус» ответил на вопросы нашего специального корреспондента, рассказав о планах и ходе строительства «Марлина»:

- Андрей, сколько судов насчитывает флот «Глобуса»?

- «Марлин» станет восьмым «рыбаком» для нас.

- Насколько рады такому судну? Насколько оно мощнее судов, что вы имеете?

- Это судно абсолютно другого уровня. Мы рассчитываем, что «Марлин» будет ловить в полтора раза больше биоресурсов, а ассортимент выпускаемой продукции будет гораздо шире. Будет порционная продукция, которая будет востребована во все времена на всех рынках в мире.
- За счет чего это судно считается экологически чистым?

- «Марлин» ловит рыбу крючками. Это влияет и на качество рыбы. Одно дело, если вы достаете рыбу в авоське, другое, как говорит наш капитан: «Каждой рыбе я посмотрю в глаза».

- Насколько автоматизированы процессы на ярусолове?

- Судно полностью автоматизировано насколько это возможно. Несмотря на высокую степень автоматизации количество экипажа у «рыбака» составляет 25 человек.

- Это норвежский проект судна. Насколько он лучше других, в том числе и отечественных проектов?

- Норвежские проекты ярусоловов являются самыми лучшими и передовыми, они лидеры в этой отрасли, поэтому у них нет конкурентов.

- «Марлин» - первое судно, строящееся в рамках программы «квоты под киль» для компании «Глобус»? Планируете ли дальше строить в рамках инвестпрограммы?

- Если бы не программа, то мы бы не занимались строительством нового флота. Однако мы с большим интересом смотрим в будущее, потому что государством предполагается 30-процентная субсидия при строительстве флота на российских верфях, и это, конечно, может быть интересно.
- Интересно узнать о «начинке» ярусолова. Расскажите об основных узлах и чьего производства оборудование на судне.

- Мы соблюдаем требования локализации на «Марлине». Наша компания старалась по максимуму возможностей использовать отечественную продукцию на судне. Однако у ярусной линии нет других аналогов, ее весь мир заказывает в Норвегии. Рыбопромысловые фабрики – тоже иностранные, потому что в России пока нет хороших аналогов зарубежному оборудованию. В вопросе добычи рыбы все-таки надо прислушиваться качеству.

- Набрана ли команда на новое судно? Что он говорит о «Марлине»?

- Пока нет, но капитан присутствует на церемонии спуска. Он смотрит на проект, а по нему «Марлин» современное и очень мощное судно.

- Как оцениваете работу корабелов «Северной верфи» во время строительства ярусолова?

- Полноценно оценивать работу корабелов буду после сдачи судна нашей компании. Я люблю на них ворчать, но в то же время я признаю, что верфь столкнулась с крайне тяжелой ситуацией адаптации норвежского проекта в России. Кроме того, сейчас глава «Северной верфи» докладывает, что в следующем году запланированы спуски-сдачи четырех рыболовецких судов. Такого в истории не было ни у одной верфи в России. Это действительно прорыв.
- Есть ли сдвиги в сроках передачи?

- Есть, они достаточно значительны. Причем не только у «Марлина», а в целом у всех «рыбаков», которые строятся в рамках инвестпрограммы.

Третий «рыбак» для верфи, что дальше?

По планам «Северной верфи», передача ярусолова-процессора «Марлин» намечена на середину 2021 года. Сегодня завод имеет достаточно большой портфель заказов по гражданской линии. Вот, что об этом на церемонии сказал генеральный директор ""Северной верфи"" Игорь Орлов: «Все, что связано со строительством рыболовецкого флота, для нас это огромный прорыв. В настоящее время мы имеем в портфеле заказов 18 судов – 14 подписаны, на оставшиеся четыре я ожидаю подписание на следующей неделе. Мы прекрасно загружены этим направлением и строим хорошие планы на будущее. Я считаю, что те компетенции, что мы нарабатываем, позволят нам строить суда и дальше. Подчеркну, что проект норвежский, а рабоче-конструкторская документация – российская. Целый ряд ноу-хау, который мы осуществили, строя эти суда, позволяют говорить нам, что норвежцам придется нас в чем-то догонять. У нас хорошо получается строить, это хороший задел. Сегодня программа строительства рыболовецкого флота у нашего завода занимает 40% от общего объема. «Рыбаки» для нас становятся одной из основных частей нашей производственной программы. «Северная верфь» загружена до 2028 года».

Программа «квоты под киль» набирает обороты. В настоящее время уже много отечественных заводов спустили на воду траулеры и ярусоловы, которые строятся в рамках инвестпрограммы. По словам главы Росрыболовства Ильи Шестакова, это совершенно новые, эффективные суда. За счет малого количества судов наша страна сможет облавливать большее количества биоресурсов. Самое главное, что инвестпрограмма предполагает, что верфи строят не просто суда, а плавающие рыбоперерабатывающие фабрики с безотходным производством. Сегодня на старом флоте наши рыбаки теряют порядка 20-30% от вылавливаемой рыбы в качестве отходов, на новом рыбодобывающем флоте ситуация поменяется кардинально.",2020-11-13T07:44:46.587Z,2020-11-13T07:44:46.651Z,

When police arrived at the property, several people fled but officers discovered 2,353 kg of cocaine in a container unit.

""This seizure has a conservative estimated ‘street value’ of some $250,000,000,"" BVI Police Commissioner Michael Matthews said in a statement.

""It is the largest seizure ever made in the BVI and the largest single seizure in the history of the RVIPF. It is also potentially one of the largest ever seized by a UK force,"" he said.

Potential production of pure cocaine hydrochloride in Colombia was up by 1.5% last year to 1,137 metric tonnes, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said in June, even as the areas planted with primary ingredient coca decreased.

Despite decades of anti-narcotics efforts, Colombia remains one of the world's top cocaine producers. Leftist rebels, crime gangs and former right-wing paramilitaries are all involved in production and transport to consumers based largely in North America and Europe.

The British Virgin Islands (BVI) is a British overseas territory located in the Caribbean to the east of Puerto Rico. — Reuters",2020-11-12T12:30:14.613Z,2020-11-12T12:30:14.635Z,

The find was made on 27 October in the port of Antwerp when five scrap metal containers from South America were given a thorough inspection, a statement said.

The haul had an estimated value of €450 million in its pure form, it said. Once cut with other products and sold to consumers, the street value would have been double that.

Antwerp is Europe’s second largest goods port after Rotterdam, but is the number one gateway for cocaine to the continent, thanks to its close trade links with South America.

Investigators said the containers initially landed in the Belgian port of Zeebrugge and were then transferred by barge to the port of Antwerp.

The cocaine was concealed in a big steel container that was itself fitted inside a larger freight container which had some scrap metal parts thrown in as an attempt to disguise the load.

It was shipped from Guyana. The final destination was a company located just across the Dutch border, they said.

After searches in Belgium and the Netherlands, three people were arrested, two in Belgium and one in the Netherlands.

The case is linked to a sting operation in September and October from which 22 suspects are still being held and three million euros in cash was seized.

Among those arrested were a former head of the gendarmerie and three active police officers.

The city of Antwerp and the neighbouring province of Limburg have been struck by a crime wave connected to the drug trade, including hostage-taking, grenade attacks and murders.

Apart from cocaine, Limburg is also known to host secret laboratories producing synthetic drugs for gangs mainly based across the border in the Netherlands.

Belgian record haul

While a record haul for Belgium, the amount of cocaine seized trails ones made in other jurisdictions in recent years.

In July last year, for instance, the US Coast Guard recovered a total of 13 tonnes of cocaine left floating in international waters between Central America and the United States, dumped by a go-fast boat surprised by authorities.

Ecuador in 2016 grabbed 12 tonnes of cocaine hidden in sacks of salt meant to be shipped to Belgium.

In Nigeria in 2006, 14.2 tonnes of cocaine hidden in a container labelled as carrying cement were discovered in Lagos’s port.

In 2007, off Panama’s Atlantic coast, the US Coast Guard found 19 tonnes of cocaine on a Panamanian-flagged vessel.

But perhaps the world record goes to a haul in Colombia that same year, in 2007, when the country’s military seized between 20 and 25 tonnes of cocaine off its Atlantic coast.

According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, the United States remains the biggest market of cocaine users, with Europe coming second, and growing.

There is “evidence of an increase in the availability of cocaine of the highest reported purity in over a decade in the European Union,” the UNODC said in its latest report this year, citing figures from Europol and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.

Cities in Western Europe showed large traces of cocaine in their sewage, UNODC said, “in particular in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom”.",2020-11-12T12:31:14.535Z,2020-11-12T12:31:14.558Z,
96,https://www.theafricareport.com/45705/libya-how-colonel-gaddafi-continues-to-haunt-the-living/,Libya: How Colonel Gaddafi continues to haunt the living,"The Guide’s shadow hangs over several ongoing legal cases, not to mention the persistent instability in the Sahel region.

Colonel Muammar Gaddafi’s remains were buried in secret in the Sirte desert in October 2011, but his ghost continues to haunt the world without respite. There’s even a person who claims to have seen the Guide praying in the South Saharan steppe in Chad in 2019.

In early October, the packets of mouldy, faded banknotes seized by French investigators from a cellar in Limoges, France were a tangible reminder of Gaddafi’s now legendary vanished loot.
The banknotes, full of history, are recognisable: they are part of €160m worth of notes in denominations of €100 and €200 printed and numbered in 2010 by Deutsche Bundesbank, Germany’s central bank, at Gaddafi’s behest. Stored in a vault at the Central Bank of Libya in Benghazi, some of the banknotes became damp and mouldy after a pipe burst nearby.

Wide-scale money laundering
At the end of 2017, when Islamists fled Benghazi as General Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) gained control of the city, the loot was taken by Saddam Haftar, one of the general’s sons and the head of a brigade. Saddam used the €80m that made it out of the water leak unscathed to buy weapons.

The other soiled half of the notes have been part of wide-scale money laundering.

Via Turkey, they made it back to Europe in small batches, purchased at a fraction of their face value. The couple arrested in Limoges had bought their slice of the loot at a discount of 50% to 75% of the cost of new banknotes. They got a hold of €75,000, one thousandth of the stained jackpot.
Not far from Limousin, France, other assets that left Gaddafi’s treasure trove a long time ago have been making the former French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, very nervous. On 24 September, the Paris Court of Appeal gave the green light to go ahead with an investigation, despite Sarkozy’s efforts to challenge it, conducted by Mediapart, which eight years ago published a Libyan document mentioning a €50m payment – in the form of banknote-filled suitcases – made to the right-wing candidate’s 2007 presidential campaign.
The inquiry led by anti-corruption judges Aude Buresi and Marc Sommerer can thus proceed. In March 2018, Sarkozy and eight other individuals were under investigation on charges of “passive corruption, concealment of embezzlement of Libyan public funds and illegal campaign financing”.

Just a few weeks earlier, the ex-French president published the first volume of his memoirs, Le temps des tempêtes (The time of storms), in which he settles the score somewhat post-Gaddafi’s death, as he describes the Libyan leader as having “a sick mind”, calls him a “pathological egoist” and observes that “he exuded dissatisfaction”.

‘The price to pay’
Why then did the French leader give a royal Paris welcome to such a person in his election year? Sarkozy writes in his book that it was “the price to pay” to secure the release of the nurses Gaddafi had imprisoned, but the Libyan Guide seemed to have other ideas.

According to Zahra Mansour, one of the leader’s former bodyguards who was interviewed by the French television channel France 2 in 2018, Gaddafi told her the following: “Zahra, don’t worry, if Sarkozy is so nice, it’s because he’s simply paying us our due.”

The former bodyguard’s honesty doesn’t seem to have sparked France’s gratitude, as the country’s Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (OFPRA) rejected Mansour’s umpteenth asylum application in December 2019 on the grounds that she was involved in Gaddafi’s ousted regime.

Another person close to the colonel with an uncertain legal status is none other than his own son and designated successor, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, located by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in November 2019 in Zintan, south of Tripoli, where less official sources said he had been since his capture in 2011.
He is wanted by Tripoli, as a court there sentenced him to death in 2015 and has refused to grant him amnesty. In March 2020, the ICC’s Appeals Chamber confirmed the admissibility of the case against Saif al-Islam for crimes against humanity, but authorities in Zintan officially released him in 2017.
He has yet to resurface ever since he announced his bid in 2018 for a future presidential election. If the tentative agreement reached at the end of September between rival Libyan factions in Bouznika, Morocco, pans out – providing for elections to be held by April 2022 – the Guide’s supposed heir could quickly turn up, like a card brandished by one clan or another, or as a truly independent political player.

A nightmare for the Wahhabi Kingdom
While his son stays silent, the Guide’s voice has risen from the grave to haunt the dreams of Saudi Arabia’s leaders. In May, a conversation between the Libyan dictator and Oman’s foreign minister, recorded sometime between 2005 and 2007, was leaked.
In the recording, Gaddafi talks about his plan to divide Saudi Arabia and get rid of the religious Wahhabi and Saudi royal family factions. A wave of protests in Qatif, a city located in the oil-rich, Shia-majority Eastern Province, in 2011 made this nightmare scenario look like a real possibility. The demonstrations were violently quashed while war broke out in Libya, ushering in a lasting period of division.

For many, the chaos that ensued after Gaddafi’s ouster is their most painful memory of Gaddafi and his Jamahiriya system. “Before conflict erupted in Libya, did you ever hear about a black man, an African, blowing himself up to kill other Africans? […] Drug and human trafficking didn’t exist prior to the Libya conflict. Our countries had peaceful relations,” said Chadian President Idriss Déby Itno during an interview in late 2019 on Radio-France Internationale.

“We learned about the decision to intervene in Libya over the radio. Today, we’re the ones suffering the consequences,” said Nigerien President Mahamadou Issoufou just a few days later.",2020-11-12T12:34:21.564Z,2020-11-12T12:34:21.584Z,

Delegates wearing masks stood before signing the agreement in Geneva with the aim to end conflict that has wracked Libya since dictator Moamer Kadhafi was toppled in 2011 in a NATO-backed uprising.

The ""talks in Geneva today culminate in a historic achievement as Libyan teams reach a permanent ceasefire agreement across Libya"", the UN's Libya mission said.

""This achievement is an important turning point towards peace and stability in Libya,"" according its Facebook page, which showed a live stream of the signing ceremony at the UN Palais des Nations.
The UN said the deal takes effect immediately.

Stephanie Williams, the UN's envoy to the troubled North African country, said it was ""a moment that will go down in history"".

""You have met for the sake of Libya, for your people in order to take concrete steps to put an end to their suffering,"" she said at the signing ceremony.

""Nobody can love Libya as much as you do,"" said Williams, who heads the UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL).

""The road was long and difficult at times. Your patriotism was your way forward and you were able to reach a ceasefire agreement.

""I hope that this agreement will help put an end to the suffering of the Libyan people and we hope it will allow the displaced and refugees inside and outside the country to return to their homes and to live in peace and safety.""

Libya has been wracked by nearly a decade of conflict.

'Crucial sign for Libya'

Rival power centres and a myriad of militias are vying for control, human rights violations have been rampant, and traffickers are using the chaos to smuggle desperate migrants on dangerous sea journeys to Europe.

The capital Tripoli in the west is held by the internationally recognised Government of National Accord, while a parliament based in the eastern city of Tobruk is backed by forces led by military commander Khalifa Haftar.

Haftar — supported by Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt — launched an offensive on Tripoli in April 2019 but was pushed back early this year as pro-GNA forces received crucial support from Turkey.

Fighting has since stalled around the central coastal city of Sirte, the late Kadhafi's hometown.

On Tuesday, the second day of the talks, Williams said that Libya's rival factions had agreed to maintain a lull in fighting and open internal land and air routes.

""What you have accomplished here is a crucial sign for Libya and the Libyan people,"" Williams said Friday.

""I am hopeful that future generations of Libyans will consider today's agreement as a first, critical, courageous step to achieve a comprehensive settlement of the Libyan crisis, that has gone on for too long.""

She said there was a lot of work ahead in the coming weeks in order to implement the commitments but it was essential to do so as quickly as possible.",2020-11-12T12:35:17.975Z,2020-11-12T12:35:17.992Z,

Over the past six days, five such incidents took place in the area, in which four tankers were attacked by pirates, and one was approached while underway with the intent to attack, maritime security company Dryad Global said on Tuesday, warning of a critical risk for mariners in the Gulf of Guinea.

Over the weekend, the Torm Alexandra was attacked offshore Benin, and the Wesley tanker was attacked south of Escravos offshore Nigeria. On Monday, the Bob Barker tanker was approached south of Cotonou offshore Benin, and on Tuesday, La Boheme was attacked in the same area, according to Praesidium International.

La Boheme, under the flag of the Marshall Islands, was the latest oil tanker to come under attack in the area when it was attacked by two skiffs on Tuesday.

On Monday, reporting indicated that the vessel Bob Barker was approached by a skiff with seven or eight armed persons on board, Dryad Global said.

“With a further failed attempt it is highly likely that the perpetrators will increase in desperation in their attempts to secure their objective which remains most likely the kidnapping of crew for ransom. As such the risk profile for the region is to be considered CRITICAL at this time with incidents assessed as highly likely / expected within days,” Dryad Global noted, as carried by safety4sea.com.

Over the weekend, the Italian frigate Martinengo assisted the oil product vessel Torm Alexandra in disrupting a pirates’ attack on the Singapore-flagged tanker, the Italian Navy said in a statement. A Navy team released by helicopter cleared the vessel allowing the crew to regain possession and keep navigating safely. The Italian frigate operated in coordination with the Benin Navy, and the crew of the vessel is safe, the Italian Navy said.",2020-11-12T12:42:13.246Z,2020-11-12T12:42:13.268Z,

Soda also called for action to address concerns that migrants were likely to be returned to detention centres in the North African country where they will face exploitation and abuse, which they had sought to flee from.

“In the absence of concrete action from States on Search and Rescue, safe predictable disembarkation and solidarity, more people are taken back to exploitation and abuse,” Soda said.

Thousands of refugees and migrants are held in about more than a dozen official detention facilities in Libya, some under control of by armed groups, in addition to an unknown number in neglected centres run by traffickers, according to the United Nations.

Human rights groups say abuses, including violence and forced labour, are widespread in these detention centres.

Last week, IOM spokeswoman Safa Msehli reiterated that the IOM had no involvement whatsoever in the management of detention centres for migrants. She added that it did not condone that system and called for its abolishment.

The Mediterranean Sea is the most preferred route by migrants from Africa, mostly from Libya, who attempt to get into Europe through Italy and Malta.

Williams added in a press conference on Wednesday that trust building measures started to take shape between the parties.

“The 5+5 agreed on the need to end the use of inflammatory and escalatory media rhetoric, to halt the use of hate speech and they urged the judicial authorities to take the necessary deterrence measures to hold accountable the channels and social media platforms promoting hate speech and incite for violence, while ensuring that freedom of expression and speech is protected.” The UNSMIL said.

The UN acting envoy also said that the parties of the 5+5 military talks agreed to reopen all roads and highways, especially those lading to Sabha city in southern Libya.

“The 5+5 have agreed to the opening of the land routes that connect all the regions and cities of Libya. The parties agreed to initiate joint security arrangements with a special focus on the road for the land routes from Shuwerif to Sebha to Murzuq, from Abu Grein to Jufra and the coastal road from Misrata to Sirte and onwards to Ajdabiya. The 5+5 agreed to the opening of air routes throughout Libya, especially flights to Sebha, which is the administrative capital of the region.” A statement by the UNMSIL explained.

According to Williams, the parties of the Libyan 5+5 military talks also agreed to uphold the ceasefire on all fighting frontlines.

“With regard to the issue of the full resumption of oil production, the two sides agreed to delegate the commanders of the petroleum facilities guards from the east and west to work directly with a representative appointed by the National Oil Corporation to present a recommendation for the restructuring of the Petroleum Facilities Guards which will ensure the increase and continuation of the flow of oil.” The UNSMIL indicated.

It added that the agreements reached by the two sides in the last two days are based on the recommendations put forward by the joint military and security committee that met last month in the Egyptian city of Hurghada. 

The two sides will take up the issue of arrangements for Libya’s central region, paving the way for a ceasefire agreement. ",2020-11-12T12:57:30.970Z,2020-11-12T12:57:30.988Z,

انتخابات عامة
وكان المفاوضون اتفقوا أمس على ما يشبه خارطة طريق لتنظيم انتخابات عامة في البلاد خلال مرحلة انتقالية توافقية لا تتجاوز سنتين، وتبدأ من تاريخ انتقال السلطة من الحكومتين المتنافستين حالياً إلى حكومة الوحدة.

وسيقع على كاهل الحكومة الجديدة عبء التصدي سريعا لتدهور الخدمات العامة والفساد وهما ملفان تسببا في خروج مظاهرات هذا الصيف على جانبي خط المواجهة.

عقبات وصعوبات
وستستمر جلسات الحوار السياسي الليبي في تونس حتى الأحد 15 نوفمبر، فيما أنظار العديد من الليبيين مشدودة إليها، آملين بحل ينهي سنوات النزاع والفوضى التي غرقت فيها البلاد منذ العام 2011، بينما يرى مراقبون أن هذا المسار التوافقي يحدوه الكثير من العقبات والصعوبات

في حين لا يزال كثير من الليبيين يشكون في مساعي صنع السلام بعد سنوات من الفوضى والحرب في بلادهم، مع وقوع المؤسسات الرئيسية تحت سيطرة الفصائل المتنافسة التي تمزقها الانقسامات السياسية والإقليمية والفكرية وتدفق الأسلحة من قوى خارجية.
تفاصيل الهدنة
كذلك، من المقرر أن تناقش اللجنة العسكرية الشتركة، التي شكلها طرفا الصراع، اليوم أيضا بالتزامن مع جلسات الحوار السياسي، في سرت تفاصيل الهدنة التي أعلن عنها الشهر الماضي بعد جلسات عدة في جنيف برعاية أممية، وبحث تطبيق مقترحات سحب قوات الجانبين من جبهات القتال.

يذكر أن تطبيق البنود التي اتفق عليها خلال الأيام الماضية والتي سيتفق عليها خلال الساعات المقبلة، يواجه تحديات جمة، في مقدمتها، الاستقطاب الحاد في الساحة السياسية والتنافس على المناصب السيادية والوظائف القيادية حتى داخل المعسكرين المتنافسين في المفاوضات الجارية لتقاسم السلطة.

Durante una conferencia de prensa, Williams dijo que se encontraba “bastante optimista” de que las conversaciones entre las partes del conflicto conducirán en un alto el fuego duradero después de que acordaron reabrir las rutas terrestres y aéreas entre ellos.

Las dos partes, reunidas en Ginebra esta semana, también acordaron mantener “el actual estado de calma en las líneas del frente y evitar cualquier escalada militar”.

Este lunes se reanudaron las negociaciones intra-libias en Suiza, con la reunión de la Comisión Militar Conjunta Libia (JMC9- 5+5, bajo la dirección de Williams. El trabajo del 5+5 JMC, la vía de seguridad, es una de las tres vías intra-libias en las que la misión de apoyo de la ONU (UNSMIL) está trabajando para tratar de llevar la paz al país del norte de África.
Los vuelos entre la capital libia y Bengasi se reanudaron el viernes después de una interrupción de 18 meses, en medio de un alivio de las tensiones entre una administración con sede en Trípoli y las autoridades rivales en la ciudad oriental. ""Un avión de Afriqiyah Airways ... aterrizó el viernes por la mañana en el aeropuerto internacional de Benina"" desde el aeropuerto Mitiga de Trípoli, llevando una delegación de representantes de la aerolínea libia junto con funcionarios de aviación, dijo el Gobierno de Acuerdo Nacional en Facebook. 

Los vuelos comerciales entre Bengasi y Trípoli se suspendieron poco después de que Jalifa Haftar lanzara una campaña militar para tomar la capital en abril de 2019. Sus fuerzas fueron rechazadas en junio de este año. Los vuelos solo se reanudaron desde Mitiga, el único aeropuerto en funcionamiento de la capital libia, en agosto, después de un cierre debido a los combates y las restricciones del coronavirus. A pesar del reciente anuncio de alto el fuego, la seguridad sigue siendo una de las principales preocupaciones de las aerolíneas libias. 

En un comunicado, la misión de la ONU en Libia dijo que espera que las dos delegaciones lleguen a una solución a todos los problemas pendientes a fin de lograr un alto el fuego completo y permanente en el país norteafricano.

Las otras son vías económicas y políticas, que surgieron de la Conferencia de Berlín de 2020 sobre Libia a fines de enero, dijo la ONU. En este momento hay abiertas tres sendas de negociaciones en tres localizaciones distintas: en Ginebra, donde empezaron las negociaciones en febrero para pautar los primeros pasos a seguir. 
En Marruecos, Bouznika, se están dialogando los pactos de paz políticos y estructurales. Y en Egipto, Hurgada, donde se están poniendo en común los pasos a seguir para un alto el fuego y acordar una reestructuración militar y de seguridad.

Estas vías fueron apoyadas por la Resolución 2510 de 2020 del Consejo de Seguridad, que instó a ambas partes a llegar a un acuerdo para un alto el fuego permanente a sus años de conflicto.

El país libio se encuentra dividido desde las revueltas de 2011 impulsadas por la Primavera Árabe. Tras la muerte Muamar el Gadafi, las crisis energética, económica y sanitaria pesan en los ciudadanos que llevan desde agosto manifestándose en las calles contra ambos Gobiernos enfrentados.

كما أن الاجتماع هو بالضرورة نتاج للجهود الدبلوماسية، خاصة الأمريكية الدفع نحو حل سياسي، وشعور الطرفين في الساحة الليبية أن الحسم العسكري غير وارد فأي منهما ليس قويا بدرجة كافية لتحقيق النصر على خصمه. وبالتحديد فقد خسر حفتر حملته التي بدأت على العاصمة طرابلس في نيسان/إبريل 2019 وانتهت في بداية هذا الصيف. وجاءت تركيا لنصرة حكومة طرابلس بحيث أخرجت قوات حفتر من كل الغرب الليبي وأقنعته باستحالة إخضاع حكومة الوفاق الوطني. وترى أليسون بارغتر، بمقال نشره موقع المعهد الملكي للدراسات المتحدة (روسي) في لندن (30/10/2020) أن الطرفين استنتجا أن التدخل الأجنبي في البلاد وصل مرحلة لم تعد ليبيا تملك مصيرها.

صعوبات

ورغم التفاؤل من الامكانيات التي يحملها اجتماع تونس المقبل إلا أن ترجمة نتائجه على الأرض ستكون صعبة. وقد تتكرر نفس الأخطاء التي ارتكبتها الأمم المتحدة عندما كان المتحاربون يتفقون على خريطة طريق ثم يقوم طرف أو أطراف أخرى بنقضها. وعادة ما تقود الصيغة السياسية التي يتفق عليها المتحاربون لمزيد من الخلافات. وطرحت بارغتر عددا من المشاكل التي تعتري اجتماع تونس، تتعلق بالشرعية وانقسام البلد إلى شرق وغرب وتداعيات أخرى. وبحسب خطة الأمم المتحدة لاجتماع تونس فالهدف هو “بناء اجماع حول إطار حكم موحد وترتيبات قد تقود إلى انتخابات عامة وفي أقرب وقت ممكن وبهدف استعادة السيادة الليبية والشرعية الديمقراطية للمؤسسات الليبية”. وما دام الحديث عن الشرعية فهناك عدة أسئلة تتعلق بشرعية المشاركين في الاجتماع، فلا يوجد مثلا وضوح أو معيار للمشاركين الذين اختارتهم بعثة الأمم المتحدة للدعم في ليبيا. ففي الوقت الذي حاولت فيه البعثة توسيع رقعة المشاركة عندما اختارت 75 شخصا للاجتماع إلا أنهم يمثلون مزيجا من الأفراد والناشطين المعروفين على الساحة الليبية منذ 2011 بإضافة حفنة من رموز النظام السابق. ولا يعرف القاعدة التي أقامت فيها البعثة اختيارها لهؤلاء الأفراد كي يقرروا المرحلة الانتقالية المقبلة للبلاد. وهناك اعتراضات من الشرق على بعض الشخصيات الإسلامية أو الموالية لجماعة الإخوان المسلمين والتي اختيرت للمشاركة. واشترطت الأمم المتحدة تخلي المشاركين عن صفتهم الرسمية وإن كانوا يشغلون مناصب سيادية أو سياسية لدى الطرفين. وهو ما قاد لتكهنات من أن المشاركين لن تكون لديهم السلطة والنفوذ لتطبيق ما يخرج عن الاجتماع. وبغياب عرابي السلطة فلن يكون الاجتماع سوى محاورة عادية تؤدي لحكومة أخرى تفتقد الشرعية ويعطي شعورا لليبيين أن الحل فرض عليهم من فوق. وكما حدث في 2015 عندما تم إنشاء المجلس الرئاسي الذي لم يحظ باتفاق الطرفين.

توزيع أم تقسيم؟

إلا أن الاجتماع المزمع عقده لن يتعدي البحث عن صيغة تقوم على تبادل وتقسيم السلطات بين الشرق والغرب. وسيؤدي إلى إعادة تشكيل المجلس الرئاسي ليضم رئيسا ونائبين يتم اختيارهم من مناطق ليبيا الثلاث. بالإضافة لحكومة وحدة وطنية. وهناك احتمال للاتفاق على إعادة توزيع المؤسسات السيادية، وهو أمر تم التباحث فيه باجتماعات بوزنيقة في المغرب حيث يتم التشارك في المؤسسات الوطنية الرئيسية بين المناطق الثلاث، الغرب والشرق والجنوب. وهذا ليس مجرد توزيع المناصب على المناطق والمدن ولكن تحويل المسؤولية للمؤسسات الرئيسية مثل المصرف المركزي والمحكمة العليا إلى المناطق وبالتساوي مع العاصمة. وسيكون هذا بمثابة رد على تهميش المناطق خلال حقبة القذافي الذي كرس السلطة والثروة في العاصمة. ورغم بداية الثورة في عام 2011 في الشرق ومحاولة بنغازي الحصول على موازاة بالسلطة مع طرابلس إلا أن الوضع ظل قائما خاصة بعد تمزق البلد إلى إمارات واقطاعيات تسيطر عليها الميليشيات والقبائل كل يريد حصته من الثروة والتأثير وبدا واضحا بعد هزيمة حفتر في المواجهة الحالية على مدينة سرت والهلال النفطي. ومع أن توزيع المؤسسات الرئيسية في البلاد قد يؤدي إلى إنهاء حالة الجمود أو المأزق الذي تعيشه البلاد إلا أن تحركا كهذا قد ينتهي بتأكيد خطوط الصدع الحالية في البلد وتعميق الانقسامات الحالية بين المناطق الثلاث حيث باتت الهوية الجهوية تتقدم على الهوية الوطنية.

رفض حفتر

وحتى لو تم التوافق على هذه الصيغة التي قد ترضي مطالب الشرق إلا أن قوى في الغرب لن تتخلى بسهولة عن مؤسسات رئيسية مثل المصرف المركزي الذي يزعم أنه سيكون من حصة الشرق. وهناك قوى في الغرب ترفض أي اتفاق يقوي حفتر، واعتقدت هذه أن خروج قواته من طرابلس كانت تمثل نهايته وأن اتفاقية وقف إطلاق النار الأخيرة نفحت فيه الحياة من جديد. وتخشى هذه القوى من تقوية اجتماع تونس حفتر وتعيد إلى عقله فكرة السيطرة على كل ليبيا من جديد. ويظل حفتر نفسه عائقا، فهو قد لا يرضى عن أي صيغة جديدة رغم وجود أطراف في الشرق تدعمها. ويرفض حفتر أي دور للإسلاميين في المحادثات مع أنه سمح للسلفيين المعروفين بالمداخلة بالنشاط وأعطاهم اليد الحرة لكي يفرضوا أيديولوجيتهم المتشددة على الفضاء الديني في الشرق.

الخارج

ولهذا السبب فحالة عدم الثقة لا تزال قائمة. ولا بد من الحديث هنا عن العامل الخارجي الذي أصبح بيده الحل والقرار، خاصة روسيا وتركيا اللتان لن توقفا دعم الجماعات الوكيلة عنها في ليبيا، كما أنهما لن تسحبا قواتهما من البلاد في مدة 3 أشهر حسب اتفاق وقف إطلاق النار. وتقول تركيا إن وجودها ليس أجنبيا أو عبارة عن مجموعات مرتزقة، بل جاء بناء على اتفاق مع الحكومة الشرعية، ولهذا لا تزال تعزز وجودها العسكري. وربما لجأت الأمم المتحدة إلى سلاح العقوبات على الدول التي تعرقل اتفاق وقف إطلاق النار، مع أن تجربة مراقبة حظر تصدير السلاح على البلاد كانت فاشلة وبشكل ذريع. والجديد في اجتماع تونس هو روح الحوار لكنها ليست كافية لكسر حالة عدم الثقة وربما انتهى بخلق شكل من الحكم في ليبيا بدون نفوذ أو شرعية.

من ينهي التدخل الأجنبي؟

وتؤكد تصريحات وزير الداخلية على البعد الخارجي في السلم المحلي، فقد نقلت صحيفة “فايننشال تايمز” (27/10/2020) عن فتحي باشاغا، إن اتفاق وقف إطلاق النار لن يظل قائما طالما بقيت الدول الخارجية تتدخل في الشأن الليبي. وأضاف أن التدخل الخارجي وعدم وجود الدعم الدولي الكافي لتطبيق الاتفاق يعدان أكبر تحد له. وتكشف تصريحات باشاغا الذي لم يسم هذه الدول الخارجية عن الحرب بالوكالة التي تخوضها مصر وروسيا والإمارات في ليبيا من خلال دعم حفتر. وفي وقت دعمت فيه تركيا حكومة طرابلس، وضخت هذه الأطراف الخارجية المال والمرتزقة من سوريا والسودان وتشاد وروسيا، وكانت موضوعا لانتقاد الخبراء في الأمم المتحدة بسبب عدم احترامها لحظر تصدير السلاح إلى ليبيا. وقال باشاغا إن حفتر لم يكن ليشكل تهديدا لولا تخلى عنه الداعمون الخارجيون له. وعلق قائلا: “هو خطير بسبب الدعم الدول الخارجية له والتي تقدم له الأسلحة والمعدات العسكرية”. وعبر باشاغا الذي يعتبر مسؤولا بارزا في حكومة الوفاق عن أمله بمغادرة كل الأطراف الخارجية بلاده. بالإضافة للدفاعات الصاروخية والأسلحة والمرتزقة. فبعد سلسلة من الهزائم التي تعرض لها حفتر أرسلت روسيا مقاتلات ميغ- 29 وسو-24 لدعم الجنرال المتمرد. وبعد ذلك هددت مصر بإرسال قوات عبر الحدود لو تقدمت القوات الموالية لطرابلس شرقا متجاوزة مدينة سرت. ونقلت الصحيفة عن طارق المجريسي المتخصص في ليبيا بالمجلس الأوروبي للعلاقات الخارجية، إن وقف إطلاق النار يعكس اجماعا دوليا على ضرورة التوصل إلى حل سياسي للمشكلة. وقال إن هناك حاجة للضغط الدولي على القوى الأجنبية لمغادرة ليبيا “من سيطلب من الأتراك والروس المغادرة” و “الأتراك يرسلون يوميا الطائرات العسكرية والروس يبنون الأنظمة الدفاعية من سرت حتى الجفرة، فهل سيتخلون عنها؟” إلا أن باشاغا يرى أن الدول التي راهنت على انتصار حفتر بدأت تراجع موقفها. وأضاف “هناك تغير في الموقف المصري، والنقطة الرئيسية لمصر كانت دائما الأمن القومي” في إشارة للحدود المشتركة بين البلدين. وقال إنه هناك ملامح إيجابية عن تغير في موقف موسكو. ولا يوجد أي تغير في موقف الإمارات التي تعتبر مصدرا لمعظم السلاح المتقدم الذي يصل إلى حفتر. وحتى لو خرجت القوات الخارجية فالتحديات تظل قائمة أمام البلد المنقسم بعد عقد من الحرب. وتعتمد حكومتا الوفاق وحفتر على مجموعة من الميليشيات التي رسمت لنفسها مناطق نفوذ في غياب الجيش الوطني العام لكل البلاد. وتحدث باغاشا عن خطط حكومة الوفاق لدمج الميليشيات التي لا سجل إجراميا لها في القوة الأمنية الحكومية وفتح المجال لها أمام تلقي التدريب الأمني والعسكري. ولكنه أضاف أن هناك حاجة لإنعاش الاقتصاد وتوفير فرص العمل. وقال “هناك حاجة لبرنامج على مستوى الدولة وليس وزارة الداخلية لإعادة تأهيل ودمج الأفراد” في المجتمع. ويعلق المجريسي أن مشكلة الميليشيات والتعامل معها تظل مهمة صعبة “فلديهم الأسلحة والمال والصلات وهم مثل المافيا” و “لهم وجود على أعلى المستويات في الدولة والتخلص منهم سيكون مهمة صعبة. وفي بعض المدن فهم مثل الجيش، ولو أصدرت أمرا لهم ولم يتبعوه فماذا ستفعل؟”.

مشكلة في المتوسط

وعلى العموم فبدون اجماع الأطراف المحلية وهي كثيرة على حل فستظل القوى الخارجية، خاصة أن كل واحدة منها لديها أهدافها ومصالحها في هذا البلد الذي لديه أكبر احتياط نفط في القارة الأفريقية ولا يبعد كثيرا عن جنوب أوروبا. فمن مصلحة الدول الأوروبية المسؤولة بالمقام الأول عن الفوضى بعد الإطاحة بالقذافي، استقراره ومنع تدفق المهاجرين إلى الدول الأوروبية. لكن غياب أمريكا سواء في ظل الإداراة السابقة والحالية التي تخبطت بين دعم حفتر ودعم حكومة الوفاق الوطني أعطى دولا الفرصة للعمل على تحقيق مصالحها، فروسيا تريد العودة للبلد الذي خسرته بعد الإطاحة بالقذافي، والإمارات تواصل لعب دورها التخريبي باسم مكافحة الإسلاميين أما تركيا فتدخلها مرتبط بالنزاع على منطقة شرق المتوسط ولاستعادة مكانتها في البلد حيث خسرت شركاتها المليارات في عقود البناء وإدارة المستشفيات بعد زوال النظام السابق. كما أن اتفاق تركيا مع حكومة الوفاق الوطني لترسيم الحدود البحرية في شرق المتوسط هو جزء من محاولة تركيا الدفاع عن مصالحها بعدما استبعدت “حلف الشر” منه رغم حدودها الطويلة عليه. وكان اتفاق أنقرة- طرابلس في تشرين الثاني/نوفمبر 2019 والذي عبد الطريق للدعم العسكري التركي مدعاة لتحالف آخر بين اليونان عدوة تركيا التاريخية ومصر في محاولة منهما لإلغاء المعاهدة التركية – الليبية. وباتت تركيا ومصر تنظران لمصالحهما في منطقة شرق المتوسط كجزء من عملية تنويع الاقتصاد طويلة المدى. وطالما بقي التدخل الخارجي حاضرا في ليبيا فلن يتم التوصل لاتفاق في المنطقة التي باتت مركز لعبة أمم على مصادرها المخزنة في قاع البحر. وكدليل على دور الدول الخارجية في قرار ليبيا إعلان فائز السراج، رئيس وزراء حكومة الوفاق عن سحب استقالته وبرر موقف بأنه طلب من أطراف دولية ومحلية.",2020-11-12T13:20:58.786Z,2020-11-12T13:20:58.804Z,

Edwin Congo and a one-time doctor to Argentine football icon Diego Maradona were arrested, along with 16 others, police said.   

The ring would conceal small amounts of cocaine -- no more than 100 grammes -- in the paper of each box which it then recovered ""through a complex chemical process"" at its labs in the Netherlands and Bulgaria, police said in a statement.   

A video released by police showed a machine crushing cardboard boxes to a pulp, which was then pressed in another container to extract the cocaine.
Police seized one tonne of cocaine in Bulgaria in January, which the Spain-based gang is suspected to have smuggled into Europe.    

The drug was infused in over 6,600 cardboard boxes containing limes and pineapples that arrived in Greece from Colombia.

Spanish police said they were led to the ring when they started to investigate the ""illegal activities"" of Colombian doctor Mauricio Vergara, who owns a beauty clinic in Madrid and is famous for having helped Maradona lose weight.   

Vergara was arrested in 2002 for drug trafficking in Colombia, while Maradona has undergone rehabilitation for cocaine abuse.    

The ring is suspected of having used Vergara's clinic in Madrid as its ""centre of operations,"" a Spanish police source told AFP.   

Congo, who retired from football in 2009, was released after being questioned by the police.

He acknowledged having traded in emeralds with some of the other suspects but denied any wrongdoing.

""I am innocent, I have absolutely nothing to do with the sale, manufacture or anything that has to do with cocaine,"" the 43-year-old Colombian told Spanish television station La Sexta on Tuesday night.

Los secretos detrás de 81 kilos de cocaína secuestrados,"Las denuncias, que alertaban sobre la venta de estupefacientes en los barrios Agua de Oro y Pico Rojo, en General Rodríguez, se repetían. La situación tuvo su pico de tensión hace cuatro meses, cuando, en un crimen mafioso, fue secuestrada, torturada y asesinada una peruana que distribuía drogas en remises desde Flores y Balvanera hasta la zona oeste del conurbano. Tras poner el foco en ese punto caliente del negocio narco, detectives judiciales y policiales descubrieron un laboratorio donde una banda criminal estiraba cocaína de máxima pureza para después comercializarla en distintos ""quioscos"".

Así lo informaron a LA NACION fuentes judiciales y policiales. En el operativo, denominado Halloween Blanco, porque se hizo el 31 de octubre, en coincidencia con la celebración de la ""Noche de Brujas"", se secuestraron 81 kilos de cocaína y 200 kilos de sustancias de corte para estirar la droga.
En el procedimiento por el cual se descubrió el laboratorio donde se estiraba la droga, armado en una propiedad de General Rodríguez, los detectives policiales y judiciales detuvieron a una paraguaya que tendría un rol principal en la banda narco. Por ahora, solo se difundió su nombre: Antonia.
Pero además del laboratorio hubo otro detalle que llamó la atención de los investigadores:la casa tenía una habitación secreta a la que se accedía tras pasar un mueble usado como zapatero. En el cobertizo oculto, de tres metros por tres y con salida de respiración, Antonia almacenaba la cocaína.
La investigación estuvo a cargo de la Unidad Funcional de Instrucción (UFI) especializada en estupefacientes del Departamento Judicial de Moreno-General Rodríguez, a cargo interinamente del fiscal Leandro Ventricelli. Participaron efectivos de la Delegación Departamental de Investigaciones del Tráfico de Drogas Ilícitas y Crimen Organizado local, conducida por el comisario Gabriel Schefer.

En una conferencia de prensa donde presentó el resultado del operativo Halloween Blanco, el ministro de Seguridad bonaerense, Sergio Berni, sostuvo que se trató del procedimiento ""más importante de los últimos cinco años"".
""Se logró desbaratar un laboratorio que transformaba pasta base en cocaína"", afirmó Berni. Según fuentes judiciales y policiales, el valor de los 81 kilos de cocaína secuestrados ascendería a los 500.000 dólares, pero como la organización se dedicaba a estirar la droga y a venderla al menudeo, se estima que podrían, incluso, haber triplicado sus ganancias.
Fuentes de la Fiscalía General de Moreno-General Rodríguez, conducida por Lucas Oyhanarte, destacaron ""la importancia de las denuncias anónimas de los ciudadanos y vecinos"". También resaltaron ""la muy buena respuesta y coordinación entre la policía bonaerense, la UFI especializada en estupefacientes creada hace un año y el municipio para dar una respuesta en la zona y no agotar la tarea en los eslabones más vulnerables"".

Además de Antonia fueron detenidos otros cuatro sospechosos. Se secuestraron cuadernos con anotaciones, 29 proyectiles calibre 9 milímetros, diez teléfonos celulares, 110.000 pesos, balanzas de precisión y una camioneta Volkswagen T-Cross.

Ajustes de cuentas
Como se dijo, el homicidio de una mujer señalada como distribuidora de estupefacientes dio una señal de alarma sobre la disputa del territorio por parte de grupos narcos. La víctima, de nombre Doris, que se había instalado en el barrio Punto Rojo, era la hija de un supuesto narco y financista secuestrado en la ciudad de Buenos Aires y cuyo cuerpo fue hallado en Lomas de Zamora, en 2018.

""A finales de junio pasado, Doris fue secuestrada, torturada y asesinada. La ataron de pies y manos con precintos y sogas. Cuando estaba acostada en el piso le apoyaron en la espalda un motocompresor hasta que murió"", sostuvo a LA NACION un detective policial.

La saña no terminó con el homicidio de Doris. Los delincuentes fueron a buscar a la hija de la mujer, una chica de 15 años que fue torturada hasta que entregó la llave de una propiedad donde su madre guardaba el dinero que obtenía del negocio ilegal de las drogas.

La adolescente había nacido en la cárcel, donde su madre cumplía una condena por narcotráfico. Salió de la prisión cuando cumplió cuatro años. Once años después fue atacada por una banda rival de su madre.

Fuentes de la Fiscalía General de Moreno-General Rodríguez explicaron que después del ""muy buen resultado de los allanamientos"" se continuará con la investigación intercambiando información con la Justicia Federal y la Procuraduría de Narcocriminalidad (Procunar) para ""avanzar sobre el resto de los integrantes de la organización criminal"".",2020-11-12T13:34:21.743Z,2020-11-12T13:34:21.800Z,

Tras varios minutos de persecución, el sumergible que tenía como destino las costas mexicanas, fue detenido por las unidades de la Armada, quienes procedieron a inspeccionarlo, hallando 119 costales que contenían en su interior paquetes rectangulares prensados y embalados, con sustancias estupefacientes y equipos de comunicación y geolocalización.

“El semisumergible junto con los costales y su tripulación fueron trasladados hasta Tumaco, donde integrantes del Cuerpo Técnico de Investigación de la Fiscalía, realizaron la prueba de identificación preliminar homologada (PIPH) a las sustancias, arrojando positivo para 2.045 kilogramos de clorhidrato de cocaína, que estaría avaluado en más de 67 millones de dólares en los mercados ilegales internacionales”, detalló la Armada.
En la operación fueron capturados un mexicano, un ecuatoriano y un colombiano. Los sujetos fueron puestos a disposición de las autoridades competentes por los presuntos delitos de tráfico, fabricación o porte de estupefacientes. Asimismo, “por construcción, comercialización y/o tenencia de semisumergibles o sumergibles agravada”.

109,https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/mundo/carteles-mexicanos-buscan-afianzar-nexos-en-ecuador,Cárteles mexicanos buscan afianzar nexos en Ecuador,"San José. – Ecuador se consolidó en 2020 como una estratégica plaza operativa para la progresiva penetración y expansión de los cárteles mexicanos del narcotráfico internacional en América Latina y el Caribe, para exportar cocaína por avión y por mar a Centroamérica, México y Estados Unidos.

La Policía Nacional de Ecuador reportó a EL UNIVERSAL que 49 mexicanos fueron detenidos en ese país por tráfico de drogas de 2018 a 2020.

Aunque los registros oficiales mostraron una intensa labor de organizaciones criminales mexicanos en diversas fases de la red de la narcoactividad, el general de distrito Gilberto Geovanny Ponce Parra, director de Investigación Antidrogas de la Policía Nacional de Ecuador, intentó minimizar la presencia de los cárteles mexicanos en territorio ecuatoriano.

“En el Ecuador si bien es cierto no tenemos cárteles mexicanos instaurados ni operando en nuestro territorio, si observamos una relación con organizaciones criminales nacionales dentro de la cadena de valor de este delito”, afirmó Ponce.

En una entrevista con este diario, aseveró que “los cárteles mexicanos vienen generando alianzas con organizaciones narcotraficantes colombianas” desde antes de que, en noviembre de 2016, la entonces y ahora disuelta guerrilla comunista de las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) y el gobierno de ese país firmaron la paz tras 52 años de conflicto bélico.

La meta de las redes mexicanas del contrabando de estupefacientes es “facilitar sus operaciones y fortalecer sus capacidades para mejorar la distribución de drogas a nivel mundial. El involucramiento en la actualidad de los cárteles mexicanos podría llegar a las primeras etapas de la cadena de valor del narcotráfico en Colombia”, como la producción, agregó.

Los mexicanos detenidos tampoco tuvieron una “participación permanente” en la narcoactividad en Ecuador, aclaró.

“Han efectuado actividades específicas de coordinación, financiación o control de las actividades ilícitas en nuestro país. Se registra también la detención de ciudadanos mexicanos que piloteaban aeronaves ilegales transportando dinero o alcaloide”, informó.

Pasadizo internacional. Ponce puntualizó que “la influencia territorial que estos cárteles (mexicanos) tienen en la costa oeste de México y en el Océano Pacífico, podría sugerir su vinculación con actividades de tráfico de drogas en nuestro país, debido al corredor marítimo que compartimos y hemos identificado en varias incautaciones”.

El corredor sobre el Pacífico es usado por lanchas rápidas y otro tipo de naves, como semi—sumergibles, para transportar cocaína del sur al norte de América. Cifras del gobierno de Estados Unidos confirmaron que al menos el 85% de la cocaína que ingresa al mercado estadounidense se trafica por trillos marítimos de América Latina en el Pacífico y el Caribe.

La ruta del Pacífico se prolonga desde puertos ecuatorianos, como Esmeraldas y Mantas, y colombianos, como Tumaco y Buenaventura, hacia la costa oeste de Centroamérica, donde las embarcaciones son reabastecidas de combustible en alta mar o en muelles para que prosigan rumbo a México. Algunos puertos mexicanos a los que llegan los cargamentos son Salina Cruz y Manzanillo.

Un recuento del Departamento de Análisis de Información de la dirección antidroga de la policía ecuatoriana mostró que “los casos” en los que mexicanos fueron detenidos en decomisos de cocaína suman 9,8 toneladas de 2018 a 2020 y “la mayor incidencia” se detectó en “tráfico marítimo”.

Los datos de incautaciones aumentaron de 2 toneladas 945 kilos en 2018 a 3 toneladas 320 kilos en 2019 y a 3 toneladas 558 kilos a septiembre de 2020.

Casos. EL UNIVERSAL accedió a numerosos casos que, en el transcurso de los últimos 10 años, involucraron a mexicanos de los cárteles de Sinaloa y de Los Zetas en narcotráfico en Ecuador.

Un reporte oficial mostró que en la “Operación Aluvión II”, ejecutada el 21 de enero de 2020, agentes antidroga de ese país confiscaron mil 120 kilos en aguas internacionales, desarticularon “el brazo armado” de una organización que envió ese tipo de droga por mar a EU y capturaron a tres mexicanos y un ecuatoriano.

La “estructura criminal” intentó enviar sustancias ilícitas en una lancha rápida a costas de México, donde se les pasaría a una embarcación de esa nación para introducirla a territorio mexicano y “enviar el alcaloide vía terrestre” a EU, describió.

110,https://ww2.elmercurio.com.ec/2020/06/25/la-produccion-de-cocaina-alcanza-un-nuevo-maximo-historico/,La producción de cocaína alcanza un nuevo máximo histórico,"El cultivo de hoja de coca, así como la producción y las incautaciones mundiales de cocaína, se encuentran en máximos históricos, según los datos presentados este jueves en Viena en el último Informe Mundial sobre Drogas de la ONU.
«El cultivo del arbusto de coca continúa en sus niveles históricos más altos», señala el documento de la Oficina de Naciones Unidas contra la Droga y el Delito (ONUDD).

«La producción global estimada de cocaína alcanzó, una vez más, un máximo histórico, y las incautaciones mundiales aumentaron marginalmente, hasta la mayor cantidad nunca registrada», prosigue el informe.

CIFRAS AL ALZA

En 2018 se produjeron 1.723 toneladas de cocaína con una pureza del cien por cien, por lo que la cifra que llega al mercado es mucho mayor, ya que los narcotraficantes mezclan la droga con otras sustancias para aumentar sus beneficios.

La cifra de 2018 es un 4,6 % superior a las de 2017. La producción mundial de cocaína ha mantenido una tendencia al alza en la última década, desde las 1.143 toneladas de 2008.

El informe explica que este incremento continuo de la producción se debe a mejoras en el cultivo -con el uso de variedades de arbusto de coca de mayor rendimiento- y en la producción en laboratorios clandestinos.

De esta forma, si en 2015 se lograban en Colombia 5,2 kilos de clorhidrato de cocaína por hectárea, esa cifra aumentó hasta 6,5 kilos en 2018.

La eficacia policial también ha mejorado, hasta incautar un total de 1.311 toneladas de cocaína de diferente pureza. La mayor parte de los decomisos se hicieron en América del Sur (55 %), seguido de América del Norte (21 %) y Europa (14 %).

El informe recoge una ligera bajada de la extensión de cultivo de coca en Bolivia, que pasa de 24.500 hectáreas en 2017 a 23.100 en 2018, mientras que en Colombia se pasan de las 171.000 hectáreas en 2017 a las 169.000 en 2018.

De Perú no hay datos de 2018, pero la ONUDD estima que en toda América del Sur el cultivo ese año ascendió a unas 244.200 hectáreas, apenas un 0,5 % menos que el año anterior.

CONSUMO ESTABLE

En el mundo hay un total de 19 millones de consumidores de cocaína, lo que supone el 0,4 % de la población adulta del planeta, y sus dos mayores mercados son América del Norte -con una tasa de consumo del 2,1 %- y Europa -con el 1,4 %-.

Donde se registró la mayor tasa de consumo en el mundo en 2018 fue en Australia y Nueva Zelanda con el 2,2 % de la población de 15 a 64 años, mientras que el consumo medio en América Central (0,7 %) y América del Sur (1 %) también supera la media mundial.

En América del Sur hay 2,8 millones de consumidores de cocaína y el mayor mercado regional es Brasil.

Argentina -con una tasa del 1,5 % entre la población adulta– ha visto casi duplicarse el número de consumidores entre 2007 y 2017, según el informe. En Uruguay el ratio de consumo es del 2 % entre los adultos de entre 15 y 64 años.

La ONU también apunta a un cambio en las rutas del narcotráfico desde América del Sur, con menores salidas desde Venezuela, mientras que Brasil se mantiene, y se subraya la creciente importancia de Uruguay como punto de partida de la droga.

«A fines de 2019, las autoridades de Uruguay incautaron más de nueve toneladas de cocaína destinadas a África Occidental en dos envíos separados», señala el informe.

El uso de «narcosubmarinos» para trasladar la droga a Europa es otra de las novedades que cita la ONUDD.

Si bien el uso de estos semisumergibles es habitual en las costas del pacífico americano, la intervención de una nave con 3.000 kilos de cocaína cerca de las costas atlánticas de Galicia (España) supone un escenario con nuevos desafíos para las fuerzas de seguridad.

También la ruta de América a África Occidental -desde donde se trafica a Europa– parece estar ganando importancia, como demuestra el incremento de incautaciones en la región: Si en 2015 fueron 1,2 toneladas, en 2018 aumentaron a 5,6.

IMPACTO DE LA PANDEMIA

El informe señala que las restricciones impuestas al movimiento para frenar la expansión de la COVID-19 han tenido un impacto en el tráfico y la producción de cocaína.

La reducción del tráfico aéreo con Europa y Estados Unidos ha llevado a un aumento del envío de la cocaína por barco, lo que parece explicar el incremento de las incautaciones en los puertos europeos en los últimos meses.

La carestía de algunos precursores químicos para producir cocaína ha podido afectar también a la fabricación de esa droga.

En Colombia, las fuerzas de seguridad «incrementaron su presión durante la pandemia» y «la campaña de erradicación del arbusto de coca continúa como se planeó».

Al mismo tiempo, la producción de cocaína parece haberse frenado en ciertas zonas, especialmente en el este de Colombia, debido a la escasez de gasolina, que es esencial para su fabricación.

En Bolivia, las «turbulencias políticas» y la COVID-19 están limitando la capacidad de las autoridades para controlar el cultivo de coca, lo que podría generar un aumento en su producción en el futuro, advierte la ONU.

Y en Perú la caída del precio de la hoja de coca puede llevar a desalentar el cultivo a corto plazo, aunque la crisis económica puede llevar en toda la región a que más campesinos opten por este cultivo para subsistir.

La ONU advierte de que la crisis del coronavirus se ceba con los más pobres, lo que los hace más vulnerables al consumo, tráfico y cultivo de drogas para obtener ganancias. EFE",2020-11-12T13:41:27.306Z,2020-11-12T13:41:27.329Z,

La investigación de la Fiscalía y el Ejército, que comenzó con información aportada por una fuente humana, mostró que desde hace tres años varias personas habrían comenzado a reunirse para enviar cocaína a Europa, en la modalidad de correos humanos, específicamente a Madrid (España), saliendo por los aeropuertos Alfonso Bonilla Aragón de Palmira (Valle del Cauca) y El Dorado de Bogotá.
Gracias a las pruebas recolectadas, se evidenció que un miembro de la red criminal era el encargado de perfilar y reclutar a las mujeres, a quienes les ofrecía oportunidades laborales en España.

Luego, dos personas vinculadas al sector de la salud serían quienes se encargaban de intervenir quirúrgicamente a las mujeres reclutadas para transportar la droga.

Labores de vigilancia y seguimiento a personas, además de la interceptación de teléfonos celulares, permitieron establecer que una instrumentadora quirúrgica, quien labora en un hospital de Cali, al parecer también participaba en las cirugías, además de un hombre que se habría hecho pasar por médico, puesto que no está titulado, y quien en los últimos días se encontraba laborando como médico general
(telemedicina pacientes Covid-19) en un reconocido hospital de Medellín.
Estos procedimientos se hacían en quirófanos improvisados en habitaciones de moteles o aparta-estudios que rentaban por días hasta la recuperación de las víctimas, a las cuales les implantaban en senos y piernas prótesis que contenían cocaína líquida.

Se identificó además que tras los procedimientos quirúrgicos, las mujeres eran enviadas en vuelos comerciales a Madrid, donde les eran extraídas las prótesis
con el alcaloide, igualmente en quirófanos improvisados en esa ciudad.

Con estas pruebas la Fiscalía imputó a 10 personas los delitos de concierto para delinquir agravado con fines de narcotráfico, al cual no se allanaron.
Las personas que fueron enviados a prisión, mientras sigue el proceso en su contra, se conocen como:

La Oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP) informó este martes a través de un comunicado de que se trató de una operación conjunta con el Buró Federal de Investigaciones (FBI), la Guardia Costera (USCG) y la Policía de Puerto Rico que culminó en la incautación de 1,497 libras de cocaína.

El comunicado detalla que se interceptó a dos embarcaciones de bandera venezolana cerca de la costa suroeste de la isla. El 1 de noviembre, una aeronave de Operaciones Aéreas y Marítimas de CBP detectó dos embarcaciones en el mar que parecían estar transfiriendo artículos que se sospechó pudieran ser droga.

El avión de CBP mantuvo la vigilancia ayudando a una embarcación de la Guardia Costera a interceptar uno de los barcos. La embarcación fue trasladada a Puerto Real, en Cabo Rojo, donde un perro de la Patrulla Fronteriza alertó sobre el olor a narcóticos dentro de 20 bultos encontrados dentro de la embarcación.

“This year, the anti-drug work is very strong, and that is due in part to good intelligence. We are making progress in eradicating acres of coca leaves, seizing drugs and chemical supplies,” Mauro Medina said. So far this year, 40.6 tons of cocaine has been seized in different areas of the country, he added.

This month alone there have been three large interventions. The first took place in Pichari, in the southeastern region of Cusco, where 297 kilos of cocaine base paste was seized.
The second took place in the province of Juliaca near the Bolivian border where 174 kilos of hydrochloride cocaine (CHC) was seized. And the third was in Huarmey, in the northeastern region of Ancash where 431 kilos of CHC was seized.

Medina said a large portion of the drug was produced in clandestine labs in the Valle de los Rios Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro (VRAEM) where he estimated there are some 20,000 acres of illegal cocaine grows.
National Police general Hector Loayza said that so far this year there have been 11,605 anti-drug operations with 8,836 tons of chemical supplies seized.

117,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2019/03/piracy-on-nigerian-waters-the-truth/,Piracy on Nigerian waters: The truth,"Globally, the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) Piracy Reporting Centre, based in Singapore, recorded 201 incidents of maritime piracy and armed robbery in 2018, up from 180 in 2017. The Gulf of Guinea remained increasingly dangerous for seafarers as reports of attacks in waters between the Ivory Coast and the Democratic Republic of Congo more than doubled in 2018.
The expansion of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea poses a dire threat to local economies, potentially undermining what little stability currently exists in the region. Oil revenue, which many countries in the region rely upon, is seriously threatened by pirate activity; 7 per cent of Nigeria’s oil wealth is believed lost due to such criminality. Additionally, instability in the Gulf has sharply decreased revenue collected from trade; Benin, whose economy depends on taxing ships entering the port of Cotonou, has experienced a 70 per cent decline in shipping activity due to piracy. Furthermore, as piracy drives up insurance premiums for international shipping companies, the price of imported goods in the region could spike, further imperilling local economies. On its part, the Federal Government of Nigeria is currently working assiduously to ensure that the Nigerian Maritime domain and indeed the Gulf of Guinea is safe for local and international shipping and has taken several proactive steps to ensure this dream is actualized. The primary approach is in ensuring that all legal loopholes related to the prosecution of offenders are plugged. The proposed legislation, widely known as the Suppression of Piracy and other Maritime Offences Bill, 2018, is being sponsored by NIMASA and has been presented to the National Assembly where it has passed the first and second hearing stages and should be passed into law in 2019: The Bill incorporates the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and the Suppression of Unlawful Acts at Sea (SUA) conventions of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) into comprehensive legislation to deal with the menace of piracy and related crimes in the Nigerian maritime domain.
The Federal Executive Council (FEC) has approved the acquisition of maritime security assets under the ‘Deep Blue Project’ which will cover aerial, joint maritime and shore surveillance systems as well as physical patrols of our coastal and Gulf of Guinea waters. The project is an all-encompassing security scheme aimed at maintaining a 24-hrs eagle eye view of our maritime domain and has been midwifed by NIMASA under the office of the National Security Adviser (NSA). On its part, the Executive Management of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) under the leadership of Dr. Dakuku Adol Peterside is fully aware of the economic losses resulting from maritime insecurity and the consequent high costs, for stakeholders, involved in adopting extra security measures and insurance premiums. NIMASA as the Designated Authority (DA) responsible for administering the maritime industry, while ensuring safer and more secure waters, has adopted a Total Spectrum Strategy to combat insecurity in the nation’s coastal waters and in the greater Gulf of Guinea area. The Agency’s Management is also aware of the effect of marine insecurity on maritime-related businesses culminating in reduced employment and business opportunities in the Nigerian maritime industry not to mention the negative international media coverage which in itself is bad for attracting and sustaining investments into the sector. The Nigerian Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre at Kirikiri Lagos will considerably enhance the dissemination of information in the Nigerian Maritime Domain. The incident reports from Masters of Ships/Skippers on piracy attacks or suspicious crafts will promptly be relayed to the Nigerian Navy for immediate response. Distress messages will henceforth be directly intercepted by the RMRCC thus eliminating the delay in relayed messages.
The Agency is working out modalities to ensure that all Shipowners install Ship Security Alert System (SSAS) which when triggered onboard will automatically alert the MRCC and Naval Authorities of any piracy attack. At the bilateral level, Nigeria has been at the forefront of enhancing cooperation aimed at improving security in the Gulf of Guinea. This is demonstrated by the concluded joint maritime security patrols carried out with the Benin Republic tagged “Operation Prosperity” which succeeded in reducing the number of pirate attacks off the coast of both countries. Participation in regional exercises has also yielded positive results with the GoG member states now conducting cross-border patrols, sharing law-enforcement intelligence, establishing and maintaining joint coordination centres through the implementation of a regional strategy. The US Navy component of AFRICOM has been conducting exercises such as Obangame and Saharan Express to reinforce and activate operational agreements. In this regard, the Agency fully participated in the 2018 version of the Obangame Express held in the GoG Region. Another example of international partnerships entered into by NIMASA in efforts to eradicate maritime insecurity involved NIMASA’s exercise tagged ‘Operation 30 Days At Sea’ which saw INTERPOL in conjunction with the NIMASA, Nigeria Police Force, Nigerian Navy amongst others to conduct patrols in GoG territorial waters in 2018. It is a peculiarity of how piracy incidents are reported that leaves the Gulf of Guinea open to exaggerated security threat levels. A situation where every incident of maritime crime regardless of nature and scale are reported as ‘Piracy’, it is inevitable that figures reflecting on these would be higher than they would ordinarily have been. For example, information from the ICC-IMB indicates 149 recorded incidents of piracy and 34 attempted piracy attacks whereas statistics from the Maritime Rescue and Coordination Centre (MRCC) show that there were only 31 cases of piracy and 18 cases of attempted piracy in Nigerian territorial waters in the same period under-reportage. Bearing in mind that most of the cases reported involved opportunistic theft from vessels and activities of oil bunkerers, it is unfortunate that the optics of violent, armed pirates roaming the GoG with impunity continue to pervade international media coverage whereas this is very far from the reality. NIMASA, on its part, has raised the issue of misrepresentation by the IMB to the International Maritime Organisation, at its annual meetings on numerous occasions highlighting the inconsistencies in the reportage of piracy incidents and the negative effects that has on the perception of the Gulf of Guinea maritime area. Regardless, Nigeria’s maritime territory and the Gulf of Guinea at large remain very viable domains that must be secured in view of the fact that activities within this domain are significant to the economic well-being of our nation and the sub-region. By securing this strategic area, we would be encouraging further commercial engagements with the international shipping community, which translates to an additional boost to our national and regional economies. Clearly, the truth about piracy in our waters is that NIMASA has acquitted her responsibilities in securing our territorial waters commendably despite ongoing challenges and has contributed, through aggressive implementation of drawn up strategies and collaboration with international agencies and Gulf of Guinea countries, to improve the security situation in the region’s maritime space.

The community said the frequent sea robberies on travelers plying the route were taking a toll on the economy of the area as cost of living in the coastal community had become unbearable for the residents.

Speaking on behalf of the people, a former Community Development Committee Chairman of the area, Asatubo Kemuel, begged lawmakers of the state to enact laws that would engender the protection of Rivers people commuting along the waterways.

He said, “It is not only Bille people that use Bille-Port Harcourt waterway, but we don’t hear about any other people being attacked; it seems as if only Bille boats are being targeted by pirates and the reason for that, we don’t know.

“Last year, we wrote a petition to the state House of Assembly and the matter was before them, a committee was set up but as we speak, we don’t know the outcome of that committee report.

“We are now calling on the state House of Assembly to revisit the issue and give us gunboats that would be positioned along the waterways. They should not only be interested in the economy and resources of Bille kingdom, the Bille people’s lives matter; they should be interested in our welfare because right now, we are being subjected to this suffering.”

DAILY POST gathered that one Tamuno Kemuel, a father of six, lost his life in the attack, while valuables of other passengers and a speedboat were carted away by the pirates.

Asatubo Igbanibo Kemuel, a former Chairman of Bille Kingdom Community Development Committee, told newsmen that the attack occurred on Sunday.

Kemuel said the incident which has left one person dead and several others missing, calls for concerted action from relevant stakeholders, especially, the security agencies to smoke out the criminals.

He called on, “The Rivers State Government and security operatives to spread their tentacles and put a stop to the excesses of sea pirates”, saying that pirate’ activities are now regular due to the absence of security checks.
The Rivers State Police Command is yet to confirm the incident.

Navy Director of Information, Suleman Dahun, who made this known in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja, said Justice Ishaq Sani gave the judgement on Monday.

Mr Dahun said the judge summarily convicted Binaebi Johnson, Daniel Lemmar and Ghane Gordon on Counts 1 and 2.

He said that the three were convicted under the new Anti-Piracy Act 2019 and ordered to pay a fine of N10 Million each on each of the counts.

Mr Dahun said during the hearing, the prosecution filed an amended charge dated August 7.

“In its ruling on the bail application, the bail application was not granted because the accused persons may not make themselves available to stand trial if granted bail.

“Consequently, the court arraigned the accused persons on the amended charges.

“During the proceedings, Binaebi Johnson, Daniel Lemmar and Ghane Gordon pleaded guilty to counts 1 and 2 and not guilty to counts 3 – 5 while the remaining six accused persons pleaded not guilty to the charges against them.

“Accordingly, the prosecutor applied to the court to withdraw the charges on which the accused persons pleaded not guilty.
“The prayer was granted and the accused persons were discharged on counts 3 – 5,” he said.

Mr Dahun recalled that the Nigerian Navy had arrested Binaebi Johnson, Daniel Lemmar, Ghane Gordon, Hassan Hakeem, Gregory Smith, Ofem Uket, John Mark, Chidi Amadi and Eze Amadi who were suspected to be members of the kidnapping syndicate that hijacked the vessel.

He said that it was reported that the kidnappers demanded for a two million dollars ransom out of which 200,000 dollars ransom was eventually paid.


Mr Dahun said after their arrest by the Nigerian Navy, the suspects were arraigned before the FHC, Port Harcourt on July 23 on a 7 count charge to which all the accused persons pleaded not guilty.

“As a result, the counsel to the accused persons made an application for bail pending conclusion of the trial.

121,https://www.thecable.ng/nigeria-loses-1-5bn-piracy-monthly-says-dogara,"Nigeria loses $1.5bn to piracy monthly, says Dogara","Dogara said this on Monday while opening a public hearing on the bill to amend the maritime operations coordinating board act.

The speaker said according to 2012 reports, the number of vessels attacked in the West African sub-region had reached a world record high.

He said the increasing attacks in the Gulf of Guinea has given countries in the sub-region a negative image.

“The increasing level of attacks and violence in the gulf of Guinea have given Nigeria and other countries in the sub-region very damaging and negative image in addition to an estimated monthly loss of $1.5 billion to the country,” Dogara said.

“If we are to make any progress in this regard, we must as a matter of urgency and necessity, pass laws that will address insecurity in the sector especially piracy.

“The International Maritime Bureau, Oceans Beyond Piracy and the Maritime Piracy Humanitarian Response Program all reported in 2012 that the number of vessels attacked in the West African sub-region for which the Gulf of Guinea belongs had reached a world record high with about 1000 seafarers attacked in that year alone. This is said to be second only to attacks in south-east Asia.
“Between January and March 2016, several attacks were reported off Nigeria’s coast. This was said to involve pirates stealing cargoes of crude oil and petroleum products. Reports had it that, no fewer than 44 ship crew members were abducted. In the first half of this year, about over 20 commercial vessels were attacked in Nigerian waters.”

He said the only way to promote intra-African trade “in our water ways is to ensure safety and security of navigation in our waters”.

The speaker said it was disturbing that pirate attacks in West Africa were said to be occurring in the country’s territorial waters.

“Thus, the onus is on the Nigerian navy to stem the tide and secure our territorial waters, in cooperation with other agencies of government. However, in the absence of enabling laws that stipulate stiff penalties and adequate funding, the navy may not be able to perform this responsibility effectively and efficiently,” he said.
“Therefore, the major component of this bill is the creation of the maritime security fund which will go a long way in providing the much needed fund that will empower the Navy to secure our waters as part of its primary responsibility.

“This is even necessitated by the fact that the Navy is not only manning Nigeria’s territorial waters, but also have  sub-regional responsibility to patrol the joint development zone between Sao Tome and Principe and Nigeria, and the gulf of Guinea generally.

“However, whatever we do, especially with respect to setting up a maritime security fund should meet the test of constitutionality guiding our fiscal matters. It should also be consistent with existing laws except where we intend to specifically amend those laws to accommodate the important issues thrown up by this bill.

“In this regard, we must note that merchant shipping and security is internationally controlled under the international maritime organisation (IMO) and we should draw a fine line so as not to upset the existing international order.”",2020-11-12T14:07:39.773Z,2020-11-12T14:07:39.813Z,

Eighty seafarers were taken in the Gulf of Guinea, a 2.3 million sq km (888,000 sq m) area bordering more than a dozen countries, sharply up from the same period in 2019, and the pirates are attacking further out to sea than before, the IMB said.
Pirates armed with guns and knives attack everything from oil platforms to fishing vessels and refrigerated cargo ships. In one attack 95 nautical miles off the coast, the furthest offshore attack reported in the region, pirates took 13 crew hostage, which the IMB said illustrated “how well-organized and far-reaching” the pirates are.

Experts say the bulk of the attackers come from Nigeria’s Niger Delta, which produces most of the petroleum from the country, Africa’s largest oil exporter, but the restive region has an underdeveloped economy and limited jobs for locals.

In 2019, Nigeria enacted a standalone law against piracy, and in August, a court in the oil hub of Port Harcourt made the first convictions under the legislation. (Reporting By Libby George, Editing by William Maclean)",2020-11-12T14:09:16.880Z,2020-11-12T14:09:16.923Z,

“The country’s coastlines are deemed to be very safe and we will not allow pirates or criminals to rob us of this hard-won reputation and create a sense of insecurity on our waters.
“I must assure you that the full force of the state security apparatus is being marshalled to curb the threats of piracy and maintain the reputation and safety of our coast,” he said.

The President was speaking at the inauguration of the refurbished Albert Bosomtwi-Sam Fishing Harbour in Sekondi yesterday.

The refurbished facility has a lay-by wharf, access roads to boats, fish market sheds, fuel dumps, an administration block, a fresh water storage tank and a state-of-the-art ice-making machine with the capacity to produce 50 per cent more than the previous capacity.
The refurbishment which cost $20 million was jointly funded by the Ghana government and Japan.

The Sekondi Fishing Harbour was constructed in 1998 and named after the late Albert Bosomtwi-Sam who was a lawyer and Member of Parliament for Sekondi.

Assurance

The President’s assurance comes against the backdrop that 14 tuna fishing companies have halted their operations in the country’s waters for fear of pirate attacks which have increased since March this year.
Three Korean sailors on board a Ghanaian-flagged fishing vessel, the Marine 711, were hijacked by pirates around Keta in the Volta Region on March 26, this year.

Within the last three months, Ghana has recorded five pirate attacks, compared to the 11 attacks recorded between 2013 and 2017.
For fear of similar attacks, and in solidarity with their counterparts, all the 14 companies that concentrate on tuna fishing in Ghana’s waters decided to halt their activities, pending “positive assurance from the Ghana Navy that the vessels and their crew will be safe at sea”.

Resume operations

Responding to the worrying situation, President Nana Akufo-Addo said the government would resolutely deal with the challenge and urged the 14 tuna fishing companies which had halted their operations because of the threat posed by pirates to resume.

“I urge them to resume. They have the full assurance of the government of their protection and safety as they go about their day-to-day activities. We will not leave them to fight this menace alone,” he added.

He said the contribution of the fishing industry remained very important and assured the fisher folk that plans were underway for the construction of many mini-fishing harbours and landing sites across the coastal belt of the country.

Jamestown Port Complex

To give more meaning to the government’s commitment to the fishing industry, the President said the government had signed an agreement with the Chinese government for the establishment of the Jamestown Fishing Port Complex at a cost of $50 million,

Under the Fisheries Sector Infrastructure Development Programme, he said, the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture would commence the development of three landing sites in Winneba, Mumford and Axim and rehabilitate three public hatcheries at Vea, Sankana and Dormaa Ahenkro.

Additionally, he said, there would also be the rehabilitation of three fish health laboratories in Takoradi, Koforidua and Kumasi, the completion and inauguration of the Anomabo Fisheries College and the refurbishment of the Tema Boatyard to increase productivity of fisher folk.

Our control

“Let me say that even though we may have little or no control over climate fluctuations or changes, one thing we can have control over is our day-to-day activities.

“Our beautiful coastal wetlands are threatened by high volumes of plastic and metal waste that chokes breeding habitats for fish. This must not be allowed to continue.

“Together with all stakeholders, let us protect endangered species, achieve food security and protect our oceans for the future,” he said.

He told the managers of the fishing harbour to ensure proper maintenance, adding: “The deterioration of infrastructure, largely as a result of our inability, deliberate or otherwise, to maintain them continues to be a serious drain on scarce resources,” the President said.

Cooperation

For his part, the Western Regional Minister, Dr Kwaku Afriyie, said the refurbishment of the facility would not only sustain and enhance the fishing industry but also ensure a steady flow of income.

He said the Western Regional Coordinating Council would continue to offer the necessary support and co-operation for the successful completion of all ongoing projects in the region.",2020-11-12T14:11:14.460Z,2020-11-12T14:11:14.502Z,

The four were shot dead in the Indian Ocean in September 2012.

The killings came to light after mobile phone footage of the incident was posted online.

Prosecutors say the suspect, a Chinese national, admitted ordering the killings while captaining the Taiwanese vessel.

The suspect said the alleged Somali pirates shot at his boat and three other boats fishing in the area, before one of the fishing boats managed to knock the men into the sea.

Despite knowing the men had no way of defending themselves at this point, the suspect told officials he ordered his Pakistani security guards to shoot them so that they could not get away and ask other pirates to hijack his vessel, prosecutors said.

The suspect has been indicted on homicide and gun control charges, according to local media reports.

The killings were exposed after a mobile phone containing footage of the incident was left in a taxi in Fiji, and found by someone who posted the video on YouTube in 2014.

In the video, four men can be seen in the water, some clinging to debris, as some 40 rounds of ammunition are fired at them. A man is heard giving orders in Mandarin.

Campaign groups have argued for years that the incident highlighted issues with lawlessness at sea, and a lack of regulation in Taiwan’s fishing industry.

According to local media reports, prosecutors have recommended a relatively lenient sentence because the alleged pirates opened fire first.

A maior apreensão registrada neste ano ocorreu em Indaiatuba, em agosto, quando 1,3 tonelada de cocaína pura foi encontrada em uma chácara na área rural no limite da cidade com Campinas, na região do Aeroporto Internacional de Viracopos, em Campinas. No mesmo dia, também foram apreendidos por Jundiaí, 277 kg. De acordo com o delegado diretor, José Henrique Ventura, só o valor estimado dessas duas apreensões chega a R$ 45 milhões – se multiplicar por três, chega a R$ 135 milhões.
“Há uma grande diferença entre a apreensão feita com transporte e de investigação. Geralmente se apreende grande quantidades de maconha, transportando. Já a cocaína é mais difícil apreender no transporte. É mais por investigação”, disse Ventura. “Nunca teve uma apreensão tão grande de cocaína pura, como esta, em Campinas ou região. Essas apreensões é uma retribuição ao nosso trabalho. A gente tem preocupação de combater todos os crimes, mas foca especialmente no tráfico porque é o entorpecente a causa de dos demais crimes”, acrescentou.
O Deinter-2 abrange as duas seccionais de Campinas, a de Jundiaí, de Bragança Paulista e de Mogi Guaçu, com um total de 118 unidades policiais, distribuídas em 38 municípios.
Somente em agosto, foram apreendidos 1.447.931 kg de cocaína, sendo a maior parte pela Delegacia de Investigação Sobre Entorpecente (Dise). Os demais pelas delegacias de área. Em junho, foi o segundo maior volume, com 326.063, seguido de abril, com 314.768. Em 2019, a maior apreensão foi em agosto, com 217.946 quilos, sendo 182.477 pela Dise. “A droga está muito ligada aos demais crimes.
Mais de 80% dos homicídios que são registrados, são por conta de acertos de contas relacionados a drogas. Os roubos e furtos também ocorrem por casa da droga, já que usuários usam o dinheiro ou os objetos para comprar entorpecente. Acidentes também”, destacou o diretor do Deinter-2. “A nossa satisfação é de dever cumprido. Toda vez que há uma apreensão de drogas, estamos livrando um adolescente e as famílias de um grande mal que ia causar”, emendou Ventura.
Toda a droga apreendida é incinerada, segundo a polícia Em 2019, o Deinter-2 incinerou cerca de 6,6 toneladas. Nos oito meses deste ano já somam aproximadamente 3,4 toneladas, inclusive a apreendida nas cidades de Indaiatuba de Jundiaí.
Entre os destaques deste ano, está o desmonte de duas refinarias de drogas, com a apreensão de 240 quilos de cocaína, além de duas máquinas de embalagem a vácuo, quatro armas – duas delas com silenciador -, e três veículos, em Campinas. Também teve a identificação de uma quadrilha especiailizada em traficar maconha conhecida como colombiana, em maio. Quatro pessoas foram presas na época e que tinham ligação com traficantes do Uruguai.

Armas
Os números de prisões e armas apreendidas também aumentaram neste ano, se comparado a 2019. Somente em Campinas, nos oito meses deste ano foram presas 2.113 pessoas, contra 2.073 no ano passado. A quantidade de armas também foi grande neste ano: 257 contra 223, em 2019. “A média de prisões por mês, em toda a região, é de 200 pessoas. O trabalho da Polícia Civil não aparece, não é visto pela população, mas há um grande resultado. Mesmo com um quadro de policiais que não é o ideal e em época de pandemia, o trabalho da polícia, em geral, foi muito bom. Esclarecemos os crimes de grande repercussão, tivemos muitas apreensões de veículos, de armas. Enfim, o trabalho está sendo feito”, destacou Ventura.

O oficial estava em um avião da Força Aérea Brasileira (FAB) que fazia parte da comitiva do presidente Jair Bolsonaro, que participará da reunião do G20 em Osaka, no Japão.

O Tribunal de Instrução número 11 de Sevilha ordenou a prisão provisória do militar, sem fiança, nesta quarta-feira (26). Ele será acusado de tráfico de drogas.

Veja o que se sabe até o momento sobre o caso:

A identidade do militar já foi revelada?

O sargento detido foi identificado como Manoel Silva Rodrigues, de 38 anos. O oficial fazia parte de uma comitiva que contava com a participação de outros 21 militares. O avião saiu de Brasília com destino a Osaka, onde nesta quinta-feira (27) ocorrerá a reunião do G20. A aeronave fez uma escala na Espanha, onde as drogas foram encontradas. 

Rodrigues já esteve presente em outras viagens como integrante do governo, entre elas, uma em fevereiro deste ano, quando acompanhou Bolsonaro a São Paulo. 

Como ocorreu a prisão?

O militar foi detido pela Guarda Civil de Sevilha, após ser constatado que ele portava 39 quilos de cocaína. A substância estava dividida em 37 pacotes  guardados em uma mala. O brasileiro será acusado de tráfico de drogas, descrito como crime contra a saúde pública no Código Penal da Espanha. Após a detenção, o restante da comitiva seguiu viagem ao Japão. 

Os investigadores acreditam que o destino final da droga era a Espanha, segundo o jornal andaluz Diario Sur. Bolsonaro viajou para o Japão em outro voo. O avião também faria escala na Espanha, no entanto, após a detenção do militar, a parada foi alterada para ocorrer em Lisboa, Portugal. 

Qual foi a reação do governo? 

Após a detenção ser difundida, Bolsonaro divulgou uma nota em seu Twitter afirmando que determinou “ao Ministério da Defesa imediata colaboração com a Polícia Espanhola na pronta elucidação dos fatos”. Ainda segundo o presidente, “caso seja comprovado o envolvimento do militar nesse crime, o mesmo será julgado e condenado na forma da lei”. 

O ministro do Gabinete de Segurança Institucional (GSI), Augusto Heleno, ainda não se pronunciou sobre o caso. O ministro da Justiça, Sérgio Moro, que está nos Estados Unidos e visitou a agência antidrogas do país, também não se pronunciou. 

Houve repercussão internacional?

A detenção do sargento da Aeronáutica ganhou as páginas de diversos jornais ao redor do mundo. O britânico The Guardian destacou: ""Aviador com delegação do Brasil no G20 é detido por tráfico de drogas”. A notícia ressalta que enquanto ocorre a prisão, Bolsonaro, na contramão de diversos países, defende a internação compulsória de viciados, endurecendo sua política antidrogas. 

O diário espanhol El País afirma que “a detecção da droga e a posterior detenção do militar ocorreram quando os membros da tripulação e suas bagagens passaram pelo controle alfandegário obrigatório após a chegada a Sevilha”. Jornais como o norte-americano The New York Times, e o argentino Página/12 também repercutiram a notícia. 

O militar deverá ser preso? 

O processo já foi encaminhado para a Justiça espanhola, mas ainda não é possível falar sobre a pena. No entanto, um caso semelhante envolvendo tráfico em aviões da FAB já ocorreu em 1999. Na ocasião, um militar da reserva foi pego com 32 quilos de drogas que tinham como destino as Ilhas Canárias. Ele foi condenado Pelo Superior Tribunal Militar em 2011 a 17 anos de prisão. 

Outros dois oficiais da Aeronáutica foram condenados a 16 anos de prisão. Os militares integravam uma quadrilha especializada em tráfico internacional.",2020-11-12T14:43:38.491Z,2020-11-12T14:43:38.576Z,

In simultaneous operations, nine men and a woman were arrested in Sydney on Tuesday and five men were arrested in the United Arab Emirates by Dubai police, according to the AFP.

Authorities in the Netherlands at the same time arrested two men alleged to have been responsible for arranging the supply of drugs to an Australian-based syndicate, the AFP said.

""The people we allege are part of this syndicate are Middle Eastern organized crime figures that are well-known to law enforcement, and for decades this group has flaunted their wealth and activities, telling the community they were untouchable,"" AFP assistant commissioner Neil Gaughan said in a statement.

""Today, it should be obvious that they are not,"" he said.

Police raided 32 homes in Sydney and issued 52 warrants on Tuesday in what they said was one of the biggest attacks on organized crime in Australian history, according to an AFP spokesman.

The investigation began in mid-2016, targeting organised crime groups attempting to import large quantities of drugs and tobacco, according to authorities.

A container of drugs was seized in the Netherlands in July which was allegedly bound for Australia in shipping containers, the AFP spokesman said.

A total of 1.8 tonnes of MDMA, also known as ecstasy, 136 kgs (300 pounds) of cocaine and 15 kgs (33 pounds) of crystal methamphetamine were seized by authorities in the Netherlands, Australian police said.

The AFP estimated the value of the drugs at up to A$810 million ($642 million) if sold on the street in Australia.

该报告全面概述了阿片剂、可卡因、大麻、苯丙胺类兴奋剂和新型精神活性物质的供需情况及其对健康的影响。报告重点介绍了特定年龄和性别群体的不同吸毒模式和脆弱性，并分析了全球毒品市场的变化。

报告表示，2016年全球药物类阿片缉获量为87吨，与当年海洛因缉获量大致相同。

报告指出，2016年全球可卡因产量达到有史以来最高水平，估计产量为1410吨。世界上大部分可卡因来自哥伦比亚，而报告也显示非洲和亚洲正在成为可卡因贩运和消费中心。

报告发现，年轻人吸毒及其相关危害比老年人高。大麻是年轻人常用的毒品。2000年至2015年，全球直接因吸毒导致的死亡增加了60%。2000年，50岁以上的人占死亡人数的27%，但2015年上升到39%。

报告显示，2016至2017年，全球鸦片产量激增65%，是毒品和犯罪问题办公室自21世纪初开始监测全球鸦片产量以来的最高记录。大麻是2016年消费最广泛的毒品，前年至少有1.92亿人使用过一次。截至2016年，全球大麻使用者人数继续上升，几乎增长了约16%。

联合国毒品和犯罪问题办公室执行主任费多托夫在纽约联合国总部举行的报告发布会上表示，长期存在的海洛因和可卡因等毒品越来越多地与新型精神活性物质和处方药共存。越来越多来源不明的非医疗用途药物制剂，以及多种药物使用和多种药物贩运，使毒品问题变得空前复杂。

费多托夫说：“《2018世界毒品报告》的调查结果显示，毒品市场正在扩大，可卡因和鸦片产量达到有记录以来的绝对高点，在多个方面构成多重挑战。该报告是我们所支持的协助将国际义务转化为实际行动和能力建设，以便作出有效反应，保护人类健康福祉的一个重要支柱。”

费多托夫表示，联合国毒品和犯罪问题办公室致力于与各国合作，寻求平衡、综合的解决毒品挑战的办法，并在实现可持续发展目标方面取得进展。",2020-11-12T15:03:46.518Z,2020-11-12T15:03:46.582Z,

据美联社11月4日报道，当天俄勒冈州超过200万人对“109法案”进行投票。这项法案允许民众合法持有“致幻蘑菇”活性成分裸盖菇素（psilocybin）。最终在超过55%的民众支持下，这项法案成功通过。

另外，俄勒冈州当晚还以59%比41%的投票结果，通过了“110法案”。这项法案将让俄勒冈变成美国首个将海洛因、可卡因和病毒等“硬性毒品”合法化的州。法案通过后，吸毒在俄勒冈州将不再是犯罪，但制毒、贩毒，以及吸毒后驾驶，仍属刑事犯罪。
根据“110法案”，如果民众持有少于1克的海洛因或摇头丸；少于2克的可卡因或病毒；少于12克的裸盖菇素；少于40剂的致幻剂（LSD）、羟考酮或美沙酮的情况下，将不再视为犯罪，取而代之的是100美元的罚款。如果吸毒者正在戒毒所接受评估，还可以免除这100美元的罚款。

俄勒冈州是全美首批合法化使用大麻的州，2014年这州还投票通过了大麻娱乐化使用，这也为俄勒冈州带来了大量的大麻税。最近的一个财年中，俄勒冈州大麻税的收入约为1.33亿美元（约合8.89亿元人民币）。“110法案”称，俄勒冈州将使用这些收入，为吸毒者提供戒毒服务。

法案声称，这将使俄勒冈州的毒品政策从“惩罚性、犯罪”的方式，转变成“人道、有成本效益和健康”的方式。“相较刑事处罚，医疗保健服务能更有效地治疗成瘾者。这是一种通过健康评估来确定成瘾者需求，将他们与所需服务联系起来的医疗方法。”

这项法案获得了部分人的支持，但更多人表达了反对意见。俄勒冈州24名地区检察官向美联社表示，这项法案“肆无忌惮地将最危险类型的毒品合法化，还将导致危险毒品的可接受性增加。”

《华盛顿邮报》认为，俄勒冈州通过“110法案”，让这州比其他放松毒品限制的州“走得更远”。并且，法案中提及的毒品，往往与严重成瘾和社会衰败有关。

曾担任白宫毒品管制政策顾问的凯文·萨贝特（Kevin Sabet）认为，刑事诉讼的“强大威胁”是成瘾者寻求治疗的强大动力。“对很多人来说，后果很重要。我认为我们可以找到一种方法，将刑事司法和公共卫生系统结合起来。”

俄勒冈州康复中心的联合创始人迈克·马歇尔（Mike Marshall）批评说，这项措施可能会用强迫人们接受评估，而不是实际治疗的系统来取代成瘾治疗基础设施。“‘110法案’的营销活动误导了俄勒冈人，让他们对青少年吸毒的安全措施弱化。”

社交媒体用户也表达了强烈的反对意见。“太糟糕了！我们将失去整整一代人，因为他们会认为这些高成瘾性的药物是安全的。这些瘾君子会夺走癌症治疗者的止痛药，而他们只需要付100美元的罚款？”
“什么鬼，我们完了。”
除了俄勒冈州外，近期美国多州都不同程度放宽对毒品的限制。4日凌晨，华盛顿特区的民众，以压倒性优势通过了一项合法使用致幻蘑菇和其他致幻药物的法案。CNBC称，这项法案并未合法化毒品使用，但这让持有毒品成为警方“最不受重视的执法重点之一”。不过，这项法案仍需经过国会审查。

4日上午，南达科他州民众也以压倒性优势通过两项法案，允许全州范围的医疗机构使用大麻，并允许用于娱乐目的的大麻使用。蒙大拿州和密西西比州，也通过了类似的法案。

法新社称，自2012年来，美国已有15个州批准用于娱乐目的大麻个人使用，医用大麻在美国33州已经合法化。

疫情之下，美国毒品滥用的情况变得越发严重。据《华尔街日报》收集到的数据显示，今年美国各地报告的滥用毒品死亡人数均在上升。去年，美国一共有7.2万人死于毒品摄取过量。美国联邦政府预计，今年美国死于滥用毒品的人数将超过去年的总和，创下新的历史纪录。",2020-11-12T15:25:09.241Z,2020-11-12T15:25:09.330Z,

余下一名30岁男子亦怀疑涉案而同时被捕。海关人员其后再于被捕25岁男子的住所内，检获约1.2克怀疑冰毒及一套怀疑毒品吸食工具。案件仍在调查中。

18歲被告鄭英傑，承認串謀販毒、藏毒及抗拒警務人員共3罪，控罪指他於本年2月11日，與另外一人販運毒品氯胺酮及可卡因；另他被指於同日在石硤尾南山邨多層停車場藏有0.62克大麻，及在該處一女廁附近抗拒偵緝警員58327。
案情指警員當日在上址附近看見被告交一些東西予數名男女，於是上前截查，但被告撥開警員的手欲離去。警員要求被告不要反抗，被告沒有理會繼續推開警員，但最終都被制服拘捕。
警員其後在被告身上搜獲毒品，經檢驗後發現為1.61克氯胺酮、1.55克可卡因，以及大麻，總值逾4600港元。被告在警誡下表示因需要錢，遂幫朋友賣毒品，案發時感驚慌才試圖逃走，並稱已幫朋友工作了20天。
辯方求情指被告母親任美容師，繼父為退休警員。而被告文憑試成績不理想，事發時因想賺快錢，所以答應以1300港元報酬替朋友工作。辯方並替被告呈上其母及社工的求情信，其母指被告本性不壞，但於去年社會運動期間不上學而結識了壞人。
法官判刑時指販毒是嚴重罪行，若毒品被售出，將毒害不少家庭，故將被告判囚。法官並寄語被告趁服刑時增值自己，望他錯而能改，莫貪一時樂，種下未來苦。",2020-11-12T15:27:03.102Z,2020-11-12T15:27:03.164Z,

在周二進行的投票中，除了新澤西州、亞利桑那州、蒙大拿州和南達科他州分別通過消閒用大麻合法化外，西岸俄勒岡州的選民也藉著公投通過，管有少量「硬性毒品」例如可卡因和海洛英非刑事化。俄勒岡州成為全美第一個醫藥用途迷幻藥物合法化的州份。

當新法例於2021年2月1日生效後，任何人若在俄勒岡州境內被發現管有少量作個人用途的上述「硬性毒品」，都不會被刑事起訴，而只需支付100美元（約780港元）罰款及去戒毒康復中心檢驗身體。

根據俄勒岡州原有法例，任何人若管有上述「硬性毒品」或迷幻藥物，一經定罪最高會被判罰款6250美元（逾4.8萬港元）及入獄1年。

不過，在新法例下，生產或銷售「硬性毒品」，仍屬刑事罪行，違例者會遭受起訴。而管有大量「硬性毒品」仍可能會被控以行為不檢的罪名。若管有「硬性毒品」的數量多到可以作商業用途，更加會被控以嚴重罪名。

俄勒岡護士協會、美國醫師協會俄勒岡分部和俄勒岡家庭醫師協會均對新法例表示支持。新法例生效後，州政府將會調配更多資源，為染上毒癮的人提供康復治療和其他服務。",2020-11-12T15:31:39.989Z,2020-11-12T15:31:40.015Z,

澳大利亚边境执法局（Australian Border Force，ABF）上周二开始对一艘中国拖网渔船进行追踪，当时这艘中国渔船进入了澳大利亚水域并走了“不寻常的路线”驶向豪勋爵岛（Lord Howe Island）。

这艘可疑船只没有捕鱼许可证，在向东离开纽卡斯尔时“曲折”前行。

据称，多达一吨的毒品从这艘神秘拖网渔船转移到了名为“Coralynne”的一艘小船上，随后警方于周六早上展开了一场激烈的行动。

全副武装的执法人员在浪高3.5米的恶劣环境下在海上突袭小船，逮捕了三人，其中包括两名悉尼人——克里斯·普雷卡（Chris Preca）和杰克逊·吉尔斯·亚当（Jackson Giles-Adam），以及来自香港的陈曼（Man Chan）。

当局登上这艘船时，据信其中一个舱室起火，但很快被扑灭。

在被新州卫生局筛查并测试了COVID-19病毒之后，这三名男子被控进口商业数量的受控毒品。

如果被判有罪，每个人将面临最高终身监禁的惩处。

　　今年受新冠肺炎疫情影响，各国不同程度地对边境、人员等采取了管控措施，天津口岸进口快件数量低于去年同期，但与此同时，查获毒品快件的数量却远超去年同期。截至6月20日，天津口岸每10万件进境快件中，平均查获毒品1.27件，同比增长90%。天津海关缉私部门今年以来共立案侦办走私毒品刑事案件31起，抓获走私毒品犯罪嫌疑人40余名。

　　天津海关党委委员、缉私局局长孙旭东介绍，今年以来，大麻类走私呈上升态势，同时，查获毒品由过去单一的大麻类向冰毒、可卡因等多种类发展。此外，通过随身行李、人体藏毒方式走私进境的难度加大，为规避风险，走私分子普遍利用食品、保健品等进行夹藏，分散寄递，具有较强的迷惑性。（马晓冬）",2020-11-12T15:36:39.355Z,2020-11-12T15:36:39.389Z,

“This is the beginning of a process that is going to require determination, courage, confidence and a lot of work and what I have seen in these two days and what I saw in Geneva was the determination of this team to implement this [ceasefire] agreement,” said UNSMIL chief Stephanie Williams, speaking afterwards to reporters.
Recommendations and requests 
Libya has been in crisis since the 2011 overthrow of former leader, the late Muammar Gaddafi, resulting in the two rival administrations, with the GNA located in the capital, Tripoli, and the LNA controlling large areas of the east.  

The meeting in Ghadames marked the first time the JMC has met in the country as previous talks were held in Geneva. 

It ended with 12 recommendations, including a request that the UN Security Council expedite a binding resolution to implement the provisions of the 23 October ceasefire agreement. 

Discussions centred around mechanisms for carrying out the agreement, including the establishment of sub-committees, according to a statement issued in Arabic by UNSMIL. 

Monitoring and verification mechanisms, including a role for international observers, were also discussed. 

Withdrawal of foreign forces 
The recommendations also outlined the formation of a military sub-committee to supervise the return of forces to their headquarters, and the withdrawal of foreign troops from contact lines. 

“In the ceasefire agreement there is a timeframe given for the departure of mercenaries and foreign forces. We have now detailed discussions on the monitoring mechanism for all of that but there is a clear sovereign Libyan request [in this regard] right now, that we have seen in the ceasefire agreement itself,” Ms. Williams told journalists. 

“The onus, the responsibility is on the shoulders of those countries and elements that are responsible for bringing those mercenaries and forces to Libya; they must respect the Libyan request.” 

The JMC also plans to meet again in the Libyan coastal city of Sirte as soon as possible. 

Much work ahead 
Ms. Williams acknowledged that there is still a long way to go. She expressed hope that “the spirit and the sense of responsibility” shown by the military representatives will be reflected in the political dialogue. 

“What I saw was the extreme confidence in the ability of the teams to work together. That needs to be translated on the ground; there is a lot of work ahead of us, that’s why the next meeting we are going to move directly to Sirte and again roll up our sleeves and go through the details and there will be meetings with the sub-committees. This is a solid work and in good faith,” she said. 

“What we are calling for is for the political class to rise to the level of responsibility that we have seen present, in the Joint Military Commission.”",2020-11-12T15:39:51.114Z,2020-11-12T15:39:51.184Z,

وعرفت البرعصي، والتي كانت تبلغ 46 عاما، بجرأتها وانتقاداتها الصريحة والحادة للانتهاكات المرتكبة على يد الميليشيات المنتشرة في مدينتها، فضلا عن دعمها لقضايا المرأة وحديثها المستمر عن الاعتداءات التي تتعرض لها النساء شرقي ليبيا.

وقبل حادث القتل بوقت قصير، كانت البرعصي قد بثت مقطع فيديو مباشرا عبر صفحتها على فيسبوك، انتقدت فيه مجموعات مسلحة مقربة من القائد العسكري خليفة حفتر.

كما ذكرت بأنها ""مهددة"" وروت قصص نساء تعرضن للاعتداء، ومطالبة السلطات بمحاسبة المتورطين.
وشيعت المحامية في اليوم نفسه في مدافن المدينة.
وتناقلت مواقع التواصل الاجتماعي مشاهد تشييعها وخصوصا شاهد القبر الذي كتب عليه ""شهيدة كلمة الحق.
وأثار مقتل حنان البرعصي ردود فعل كثيرة مستنكرة ومطالبة ""بإحقاق العدالة""، وعبر مغردون عن سخطهم وقلقهم من ""الجرائم المتكررة المرتكبة ضد الناشطات"".
كما ربط مغردون بين اغتيال البرعصي وتصريحاتها السابقة التي انتقدت فيها نجل القيادي خليفة حفتر، صدام، بسبب حصوله على منصب قيادي في الجيش بالرغم من صغر سنه، مطالبة بالمساواة.
وأدانت منظمة العفو الدولية اغتيال المحامية البرعصي مطالبة بفتح تحقيق.

واعتبرت أن قتلها يعد ""دليلا على المخاطر التي تواجهها النساء في ليبيا اللواتي يقمن بالحديث على أمور سياسية"".

وأضافت المنظمة أن البرعصي ""دأبت على انتقاد عدد من الأفراد المرتبطين بالمجموعات المسلحة"" في شرق ليبيا، و""تلقت عدة تهديدات بما فيها التهديد بالقتل لها ولابنتها على خلفية تلك الانتقادات"".
كما أدانت بعثة الأمم المتحدة للدعم في ليببا اغتيال حنان البرعصي داعية السلطات إلى ""إنهاء الحالة السائدة المتسمة بالإفلات من العقاب"".
ووقعت جريمة القتل بعد حوالي عام ونصف عام من اختفاء النائبة سهام سرقيوة التي خطفتها مجموعة مسلحة في بنغازي بعدما انتقدت الهجوم الذي شنه القيادي حفتر على طرابلس، ولم يتم العثور عليها منذ ذلك الحين.

وفي تصريح صحافي قالت رئيسة بعثة الأمم المتّحدة للدعم في ليبيا بالإنابة ستيفاني وليامز إن الممثلين القادمين من مختلف أنحاء ليبيا “توصّلوا إلى خارطة طريق مبدئية لإنهاء الفترة الانتقالية وتنظيم انتخابات رئاسية وبرلمانية حرّة، نزيهة، شاملة، وذات مصداقية”.

وترمي المفاوضات التي تجري في تونس إلى إيجاد إطار عمل وحكومة موقتة تكلّف تنظيم الانتخابات وتوفير الخدمات في بلاد دمّرتها الحرب على مدى سنوات، وفاقمت جائحة كوفيد-19 معاناة أبنائها.

وشدّدت وليامز على ضرورة الإسراع في المضي قدماً إلى “انتخابات عامّة يجب أن تكون شفّافة ومبنية على الاحترام التامّ لحرية التعبير والتجمّع”.

وبموازاة المحادثات التي تستضيفها تونس، مفاوضات عسكرية تجرى في ليبيا لاستكمال اتفاق وقف إطلاق النار تاريخي تم التوصّل إليه في تشرين الأول/أكتوبر.

وتنتشر في ليبيا فصائل مسلّحة عدة تنقسم بين معسكرين رئيسيين: حكومة الوحدة الوطنية ومقرّها العاصمة طرابلس، وسلطة موازية في الشرق يدعمها المشير النافذ خليفة حفتر.

ويشارك في الحوار 75 شخصا اختارتهم الأمم المتحدة لتمثيل النسيج السياسي والعسكري والاجتماعي للبلاد، في خطوة أثارت انتقادات للعملية وتشكيكا بمصداقيتها.

وتعهّد المشاركون في الحوار عدم المشاركة في الحكومة المرتقبة.

وبالموازاة تجري بموازاة اجتماعات متواصلة للجنة عسكرية مشتركة تضم كبار قادة قوات حفتر والقوات الموالية لحكومة الوفاق تجرى في سرت، مسقط رأس الدكتاتور معمّر القذافي الذي حكم ليبيا على مدى عقود قبل ان تطيحه في العام 2011 انتفاضة شعبية مدعومة من حلف شمال الأطلسي.

وطغى اغتيال المحامية الليبية حنان البرعصي الناشطة في الدفاع عن حقوق النساء في مدينة بنغازي الثلاثاء في وضح النهار على يد مسلّحين مجهولين على محادثات يوم الأربعاء.

واعتبرت وليامز أن “فجيعة مقتلها تدلّل على التهديدات التي تواجهها المرأة الليبية التي تتجرأ على المجاهرة برأيها”.

وفي بيان بموقع ""تويتر""، قال المتحدث باسم قوات حكومة الوفاق، العقيد محمد قنونو: ""نلفت انتباه البعثة الأممية إلى أن ما يحدث حتى الآن في لقاءات اللجنة العسكرية، لا يصب في اتجاه وقف دائم لإطلاق النار"".
وفيما يتعلق بالتحفظ على اجتماع اللجنة في سرت، قال قنونو: ""التحركات العسكرية في محيط سرت إلى الجفرة لا توحي بنية إخلاء المنطقة من الميليشيات المسلحة والبعثة لا تجهل ذلك، كما لا يمكن اعتبار ما جرى في سرت بالخطوة للإمام، بل هي خطوة في الهواء إن لم نقل للخلف"".

وأضاف قائلا إن ""لم يصحح الوضع فنخشى قول إن المفاوضات قد لا تؤتي أكلها ... لا نريد تكون هذه الممارسات سبباً في إفشال مسار الحوار السلمي، ولا نقبل التفاوض تحت حراب المرتزقة ودفاعاتهم الجوية"".

وأعرب المتحدث العسكري عن استغرابه بشأن أسباب هبوط طائرة وفد حكومة الوفاق العسكري خارج سرت، قائلا: ""لماذا تنزل طائرة وفدنا العسكري على بعد 170 كم شرقي سرت رغم وجود مطارين بمدينة سرت حاضنة اللقاء؟"".

ولم تعلق بعثة الأمم المتحدة على موقف قوات حكومة الوفاق حتى الآن، بحسب ""فرانس برس"".

وشنّ المشير خليفة حفتر هجوماً للسيطرة على طرابلس حيث مقرّ حكومة الوفاق التي استعادت السيطرة على غرب ليبيا بالكامل إثر معارك انتهت مطلع يونيو/ حزيران الماضي بانسحاب قوات حفتر باتجاه مدينة سرت.

نلفت انتباه البعثة الأممية في #ليبيا إلى أن ما يحدث حتى الآن في لقاءات اللجنة العسكرية (5+ 5) لا يصب في اتجاه وقف دائم لإطلاق النار، ونقف عند نقاط نراها غاية في الأهمية:
وإثر ذلك، نجحت الجهود الدبلوماسية في وقف الأعمال العسكرية، وتوج ذلك بتوقيع اللجنة العسكرية الليبية (5+5) في جنيف برعاية أممية نهاية الشهر الماضي، اتفاقا دائماً لوقف إطلاق النار.

وأعقب ذلك توصل وفدا اللجنة العسكرية (5+5) في اجتماع غدامس بليبيا الأسبوع الماضي إلى توافق على كامل بنود تطبيق اتفاق وقف إطلاق النار، من بينها تشكيل لجنة للإشراف على خروج القوات الأجنبية من البلاد.

كما تم اختيار مدينة سرت مقرا للجنة (5+5).

وأعلنت بعثة الأمم المتحدة اختيار سرت لعقد الجلسة السادسة من محادثات اللجنة في الفترة بين 10 و13 نوفمبر/ تشرين الثاني الجاري، لاستكمال آليات تنفيذ اتفاق وقف إطلاق النار.

شكل اغتيال الناشطة الحقوقية حنان البرعصي، المعروفة بـ""عزوز برقة""، وسط مدينة بنغازي، وفي وضح النهار، صدمة لدى سكان وقبائل الشرق الليبي، الخاضع لسيطرة مليشيات الانقلابي خليفة حفتر، ودليلا على الانفلات الأمني بالمنطقة.

وجاء اغتيال البرعصي (47 عاما) بعد دقائق من بثها فيديو مباشر على شبكات التواصل الاجتماعي، تهاجم فيه حفتر، ونجله صدام، وتطرح أسئلة حول ترقية الأخير إلى رتبة عقيد خلال أربع سنوات فقط، وعن الثروة التي أصبح يمتلكها خلال هذه الفترة.

وتحدثت وسائل إعلام محلية أن مجموعة ملثمة على متن ثلاث سيارات تتبع مليشيا ""اللواء 106""، الذي يقوده صدام حفتر، وأمام مرأى ومسمع من المارة، أطلقت 27 رصاصة، على الأقل، على جسد ""حنان البرعصي"" فأردتها قتيلة، بشارع عشرين، وسط بنغازي.

وأعاد اغتيال البرعصي، الجرائم التي ارتكبت خلال السنوات الأخيرة في حق ناشطات حقوقيات تجرأن على انتقاد حفتر ومليشياته، على غرار اختطاف النائبة سهام سرقيوة، من بيتها وأمام زوجها وابنها في يوليو/تموز 2019، وسلوى بوقعيقص في يونيو/حزيران 2014.

لكن هذه المرة كانت ردود الفعل الداخلية والدولية قوية، سواء تنديد السفارات الأمريكية والبريطانية والألمانية والأمم المتحدة والاتحاد الأوروبي ضد هذه الجريمة، أو من طرف أعيان وشباب قبيلة البراعصة في مدينة البيضاء (شرق)، وحتى أنصار النظام السابق، فضلا عن الحكومة الليبية في طرابلس، والهيئات والمنظمات الحقوقية المحلية والدولية.

** خطوة إلى الخلف

وأمام هذا الضغط الدولي والداخلي، وبعد أكثر من 24 ساعة من صمت حفتر على هذا الاغتيال، خرج الناطق باسمه أحمد المسماري، مساء الأربعاء، ليعلن إدانة الانقلابي حفتر لهذه الجريمة خلال اجتماع مع قائد أركانه عبد الرزاق الناظوري وإبراهيم بوشناف وزير داخلية الحكومة الموازية غير المعترف بها دوليا.

ومتجاهلا أن المتهم الرئيسي في اغتيال البرعصي، هو نجله صدام ومليشيا 106، إلا أن حفتر زعم أن ""لا أحد فوق القانون""، في محاولة لامتصاص غضب قبائل الشرق وخاصة البراعصة الذين أعلنوا أنهم ""أولياء دم""، أي أنهم سيقتصون من قاتل ""عزوز برقة"".

لكن عدة ناشطين ليبيين، مازالوا يتساءلون عن عدم القصاص إلى اليوم من خاطفي النائبة سرقيوة، والذين ارتكبوا عدة جرائم قتل وتعذيب واغتصاب واستيلاء على أراضي المواطنين، على غرار عائلة الحوتي في ضواحي بنغازي.

ويعكس هذا الوضع غياب المساءلة القانونية، وانفلات أمني في الشرق الليبي الخاضع لسيطرة حفتر وأبنائه، دون وجود سلطة فعلية تستطيع محاسبتهم على جرائمهم.

وتعزز هذه الجريمة موقف قادة ""بركان الغضب"" التابع للجيش الليبي، رفضهم لأي دور يمكن أن يلعبه حفتر، في مستقبل البلاد.

** القاهرة تفتح قنوات اتصال مع الغرب الليبي

لكن حفتر لا يواجه فقط رفضا من خصومه في الغرب الليبي، بل أيضا فقدَ ثقة بعض حلفائه الدوليين، على غرار مصر، خاصة بعد فشله المتكرر في السيطرة على طرابلس، رغم الدعم العسكري الكبير الذي قدم له.

ورغم أن مصر كانت ماضية في بناء مشروع تسليح قبائل الشرق الليبي، كبديل لفشل مليشيات حفتر، إلا أن رفض الجزائر الصريح لهذا المشروع، وضغط الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية بقوة نحو الحل السياسي برعاية الأمم المتحدة، دفع القاهرة لإعادة ترتيب حساباتها.

وطالبت عدة شخصيات مثقفة موالية للنظام المصري، بضروة الانفتاح على ""القبائل العربية في مدينة مصراتة"" (200 كلم شرق طرابلس)، والتي تعتبر كتائبها القوة الرئيسية في الجيش الليبي الذي منع سقوط العاصمة في يد حفتر.

ويبدو أن صناع القرار في النظام المصري بدؤوا يقتنعون بهذه المقاربة، مع تمسكهم بعدائهم الهستيري ضد كل ما يرمز للإخوان المسلمين، ومن يسمونهم بـ""المليشيات""، في إشارة إلى الكتائب التي أطاحت بنظام معمر القذافي ووقفت في وجه ""الثورة المضادة"" التي يقودها حفتر.

ففي سبتمبر/أيلول الماضي، استقبلت القاهرة وفدا من الغرب الليبي مشكل من 9 أعضاء، 4 منهم من مصراتة، بهدف فتح قناة اتصال جديدة، بعد أن اهتزت صورتها في طرابلس إثر دعمها الفج لحفتر.

كما أن ازدياد النفوذ الروسي في شرق ليبيا على حساب مصر، شجع الأخيرة على توسيع أوراق لعبها وعدم وضع كامل بيضها في سلة حفتر أو حتى عقيلة صالح، رئيس مجلس نواب طبرق (شرق).

وشكل الصعود المتزايد لفتحي باشاغا، وزير الداخلية في الحكومة الشرعية بطرابلس، فرصة للقاهرة لجس نبض إمكانية ربط صلات تعاون معه.

فباشاغا، لعب دورا مهما في إطلاق سراح عمال مصريين، اعتقلوا في غرب ليبيا، عقب اندحار مليشيات حفتر إلى الشرق.

وهذه الحادثة منحت باشاغا مصداقية لدى السلطات المصرية باعتباره رجل دولة قوي، يمكنه ضبط تصرفات بعض المجموعات المسلحة غير المنضبطة.

ناهيك عن تبنيه مشروع ""تفكيك وإعادة دمج"" المسلحين في المؤسسات الأمنية والعسكرية، بدعم من القيادة العسكرية الأمريكية في إفريقيا (أفريكوم)، وهو ما يتقاطع مع دعوات القاهرة لحل من تسميهم بـ""المليشيات"".

لذلك فزيارة باشاغا إلى مصر، في 4 نوفمبر/تشرين الثاني الجاري، ثم فائز السراج، رئيس المجلس الرئاسي، في 10 من ذات الشهر، تأتي ضمن هذه السياقات.

فضلا عن رغبة القاهرة في أن يكون لها دور مؤثر في تشكيل المجلس الرئاسي المقبل.

إذ أن باشاغا، مرشح لأن يكون رئيسا للحكومة المقبلة، أو رئيسا للمجلس الرئاسي، أو البقاء في منصبه وزيرا للداخلية على الأقل.

يأتي ذلك، في ظل استعداد السراج، للتنحي من منصبه، بينما لا يحظى نائبه أحمد معيتيق (من مصراتة أيضا)، بدعم كافٍ من النافذين في المنطقة الغربية، رغم أن حفتر يفضله على باشاغا، بعد اتفاق النفط المثير للجدل الذي توصل إليه الطرفان.

لكن من المستبعد أن تستبدل القاهرة حفتر وعقيلة بباشاغا، لكنها قد تحاول إقناع الأخير بأن يكون للجنرال الانقلابي دور في المرحلة المقبلة، رغم تراجع أسهمه كثيرا خاصة مع مقتل ""عزوز برقة"".",2020-11-12T15:54:07.047Z,2020-11-12T15:54:07.089Z,

يحضر المنتدى، الذي يُعقد برعاية بعثة الأمم المتحدة لدعم السلام في ليبيا، 75 مندوبا يمثلون مختلف قطاعات وشرائح المجتمع الليبي. ويحتضن منتجع قمرت السياحي في ضواحي العاصمة التونسية، الملتقى السياسي والمحادثات، التي تدور منذ الإثنين.

وبحسب التكبالي، عضو لجنة الدفاع والأمن بمجلس النواب، الموجود حاليا في تونس والذي لا يشارك في الملتقى، فإن الحدث يقام في ظروف سرية بعيدة عن الإعلام وراء أبواب مغلقة.

وأفاد التكالبي أن البعثة الأممية قامت بمنع المشاركين من الاتصال بالعالم الخارجي، فالملتقى غير واضح تماما ولا تصل فعالياته إلى الرأي العام. لقد وصلتني بعض الأخبار عن انقسامات معينة في وجهات النظر ، وهناك عدة تناقضات وتدخلات خارجية"".

ووجه عضو لجنة الدفاع والأمن بمجلس النواب تساؤلاً حول سبب تواجد 70% من ممثلي التيار الإسلامي. فهذا يعني أن بعثة الأمم المتحدة تريد خلق مشكلة وفتنة كبيرتين لأن الليبيين لا يريدون ""الاخوان"" فهم ليس لديهم أي تأثير أو كلمة في المجتمع الليبي، لماذا يتم فرضهم؟"".

وصرّح التكبالي قائلا ""قادة الجماعات المسلحة في طرابلس والقبائل الليبية يعارضون تكوين المشاركين في المنتدى الذين اختارتهم بعثة الأمم المتحدة"".

وبحسب النائب، فإن المنتدى ""يضم أشخاصًا ليس لديهم دعم حقيقي وليس لديهم تأثير في المجتمع الليبي"". وإن 45 من أصل 75 مندوبًا في المنتدى هم أعضاء أو مؤيدون وداعمون لجماعة الإخوان المسلمين.

وأضاف: ""لا أولئك الذين أطاحوا بالنظام السابق، ولا أولئك الذين يمثلون النظام السابق، الذين يدعمهم معظم الليبيين اليوم، ولا القبائل يتم تمثيلهم هناك. إنهم يريدون لممثلي الإسلام السياسي أن تكون لهم اليد العليا"".

وبحسب علي التكبالي، ""هناك محاولة لفرض مرشحين لأعلى المناصب في الدولة من ممثلين عن مدينة مصراتة"" ، بمن فيهم وزير الداخلية في حكومة الوفاق الوطني فتحي باشاغا. وأشار النائب إلى أن ترشيح الوزير لمنصب رئيس وزراء ليبيا ، يدفعه عدد من قيادات الإخوان، كما يدفعون بغيره من المرشحين لمناصب عليا.

وقال النائب ""اتضح أن بعثة الأمم المتحدة إما لا تفهم ما تفعله أو لا تريد الاستقرار لليبيا. حتى لو فُرضت هذه الأسماء علينا فإنها ستسبب مشكلة"".

ويتألف مجلس الرئاسة الجديد من رئيس ونائبين. سيمثل كل عضو من أعضاء المجلس إحدى مناطق ليبيا الثلاث (ثلاث مناطق تاريخية في ليبيا: طرابلس وبرقة وفزان). كما يتعين على رئيس الحكومة ونائبيه تمثيل مناطق مختلفة من البلاد.

بعد موافقة مجلس النواب الليبي والمجلس الأعلى للدولة على تشكيل الحكومة في البلاد ، بحسب معدي الوثيقة ، ستبدأ فترة انتقالية لا تزيد عن 18 شهرًا. و في النهاية سيتم إجراء انتخابات رئاسية و برلمانية.

وتتواصل المواجهات بين حكومة الوفاق الوطني بقيادة فايز السراج والمدعومة من طرف تركيا التي تسيطر على طرابلس وأراضي غرب البلاد، وبين الجيش الوطني الليبي بقيادة المشير خليفة حفتر الذي يتعاون مع مجلس النواب في الشرق. كما صرحت وزارة الخارجية الروسية أن الهدف من الجهود في ليبيا هي استعادة سيادة البلاد.",2020-11-12T15:55:15.686Z,2020-11-12T15:55:15.711Z,

The 46-year old lawyer was female, after all, in a conservative culture that often defers to women. She hailed from a famous and powerful Libyan tribe, and she had repeatedly voiced support for renegade commander Khalifa Haftar, who controls the east, even as she posted regular videos detailing the corruption and brutality of his deputies, including his adult sons.

But, in the end, her status failed to shield her. She was brutally gunned down on Tuesday by masked men while she was shopping in a busy district of Benghazi.  

“They came to her death-squad style,” said Hanan Salah, Libya researcher at Human Rights Watch, who has spoken to witnesses and medical authorities in Benghazi.

Ms Barassi’s injuries, including one or more gunshots to the head, were massive, and she appears to have died on the spot, said Ms Salah. United Nations officials, as well as envoys from western nations, quickly condemned the killing.
“Her tragic death illustrates the threats faced by Libyan women as they dare to speak out,” the UN’s mission to Libya said in a statement.
The killing of the activist comes almost a year and a half after the disappearance of lawmaker Siham Sergewa. She was abducted by unknown gunmen after she criticised Mr Haftar’s ultimately disastrous decision to launch an offensive to take control of the capital, which is under the control of Libya’s internationally recognised government.  

Mr Haftar, after international outrage erupted over the killing, condemned the murder. “The commander-in-chief condemns in the strongest terms the sinful attack,” the spokesman for his Libyan Arab Armed Forces, said a a day after the killing. 

The killing underscores the strangling of Libyan civilian society under Mr Haftar and other armed groups that dominate the country and have smothered the aspirations for freedom and democratic change which were unleashed by the massive uprising that toppled the country’s longtime dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, nearly a decade ago.  
“This execution will have a chilling effect on activism in eastern Libya and Libya in general,” said Ms Salah. “Activists and journalists are under massive pressure not to speak up as they can face such consequences.”

Ms Barassi had occupied a unique position in eastern Libya: one of the activists to speak openly, circumventing tight controls on broadcast media by posting videos to her own Facebook page. She addressed accusations of corruption and human rights violations that were allegedly perpetrated by the armed groups lording over the country, often naming people whom she accused of stealing public wealth, or even engaging in sexual assault or rape of women.  “She was trying to bring to light these very taboo subjects,” said Ms Salah. “This definitely put her at risk.”

Among those she named were Mr Haftar’s adult sons Saddam and Khalid and his son-in law Ayoub whom she accused of engaging in various enrichment schemes. Even as she pledged loyalty to Mr Haftar, “she was a big critic of the family members,” said Ms Salah. 

Amnesty International said she had threatened to expose corruption allegations involving Mr Haftar’s shortly before before she was killed. Several days ago Ms Barassi posted a video showing what she said was the bullet-riddled car of her daughter, who she said had been shot at potentially as a warning to her. 

Libya’s lawyers’ syndicate disclosed that security forces had summoned members of its Benghazi branch on Monday and told them to “silence” Ms Barassi, according to local news accounts. 

Ms Barassi was in a shop on Benghazi’s busy Road 20 when at least three gunmen arrived in two or three cars with blackened windows and no registration plates. Some witnesses described a struggle in which the gunmen attempted to kidnap her, but Ms Salah could not confirm that account.  

“She was not killed from across the street,” she said. “Masked men shot her dead at close range.”

Benghazi authorities have publicly vowed to investigate the murder and attempt to bring the killers to justice, but many fear they will get away with it, and that the brazen nature of the murder was part of the plan.  

“It definitely is to make a very public point, and clearly these people feel invincible,” said Ms Salah. “No one’s going to question them and no one’s going to reach them.”",2020-11-12T15:56:48.940Z,2020-11-12T15:56:48.996Z,

Les analyses de l’OCDE montrent que les financements publics et privés mobilisés par les pays développés ont atteint 78,9 milliards de dollars en 2018, dont 64,3 milliards de dollars de financements publics et 14,6 milliards de dollars de financements privés mobilisés par des interventions publiques. Ces financements ont connu une augmentation de 11 % par rapport à 2017, portée notamment par les financements d’origine publique.

En 2009, les pays développés se sont engagés collectivement à mobiliser 100 milliards de dollars par an de financements climat pour les pays en développement à partir de 2020. En 2015 à la COP21, cet engagement a été confirmé jusqu’en 2025.

La France a pleinement contribué à la progression observée par l’OCDE, avec 5,08 milliards d’euros de financements climat fournis par la France pour les pays en développement en 2018, dont 1,3 milliard d’euros pour l’adaptation. Cet important effort de la France a été confirmé en 2019, avec 5,96 milliards d’euros de financements climat dont 1,55 milliard d’euros pour l’adaptation. La France a donc atteint de manière anticipée les objectifs fixés par le Président de la République, à savoir au moins 5 milliards d’euros de financements climat d’ici 2020 dont 1,5 milliard d’euros pour l’adaptation. Cette augmentation s’inscrit dans le cadre d’un effort européen : les financements climat de l’UE et de ses États-membres sont passés de 9,6 milliards d’euros en 2013 à 21,7 milliards d’euros en 2018 puis 23,2 milliards d’euros en 2019 (en UE-28).

Jean-Yves Le Drian, ministre de l’Europe et des Affaires étrangères, a déclaré : « Le rapport de l’OCDE montre que les pays développés sont sur la bonne trajectoire pour tenir leurs engagements mais nous devons poursuivre les efforts. La France est pleinement engagée sur la scène internationale pour mobiliser les financements nécessaires. Cinq ans après l’adoption de l’accord de Paris, le sommet de l’ambition pour le climat, organisé le 12 décembre prochain par le Royaume-Uni, la France, les Nations unies, le Chili et l’Italie, sera l’occasion pour de nombreux États d’annoncer le rehaussement de leurs ambitions en matière de lutte contre le changement climatique. »

Barbara Pompili, ministre de la Transition écologique, a déclaré : « C’est à l’occasion de la signature de l’Accord de Paris en 2015 que les pays développés se sont engagés à mobiliser 100Md$ par an d’ici 2020 et jusqu’en 2025 pour accompagner la transition écologique des pays en développement. Le travail rigoureux et reconnu de l’OCDE permet de faire la transparence sur cet engagement et de constater que la tendance est à l’augmentation et que la France prend sa part de l’effort commun. Il faut néanmoins encore amplifier cette dynamique, notamment en direction d’un équilibre entre atténuation du réchauffement climatique et adaptation à ses conséquences, surtout en faveur des pays en développement les plus touchés et vulnérables. »

Bruno Le Maire, ministre de l’Économie, des Finances et de la Relance, a déclaré : « Tous les pays font face à une crise économique sans précédent. Mais nous devons continuer à nous mobiliser pour atteindre les objectifs de l’Accord de Paris, car l’urgence climatique demeure. Nous pouvons faire de cette crise une opportunité pour accélérer la transition de nos économies vers un modèle plus respectueux de l’environnement.

Brittany Ferries said reservations for August are 'encouraging' considering the reduced onboard capacity to be in line with social distancing requirements.

Many of its August passengers are those who have moved their crossings after cancellations earlier in the year.

« Un succès majeur contre le terrorisme »
L’ancien officier de l’armée malienne, également connu sous le nom de Bamoussa Diarra, était un lieutenant d’Iyad Ag Ghali, le chef touareg du Rassemblement pour la victoire de l’Islam et des musulmans (RVIM), lié à Al Qaïda.

Cadre historique de la mouvance djihadiste au Sahel, Bah ag Moussa est considéré comme responsable de plusieurs attaques contre les forces maliennes et internationales, dit Florence Parly dans un communiqué qui salue un succès majeur dans la lutte contre le terrorisme.

Cette intervention a été lancée alors que vient de s’achever une opération d’envergure de la force Barkhane et ses alliés africains et européens contre les groupes liés à Al Qaïda et à l’État islamique dans la zone dite des trois frontières, pendant laquelle des dizaines de djihadistes ont été tués.

Le djihadiste avait déserté l’armée malienne dès 2012
Bah ag Moussa avait déserté l’armée malienne dès 2012 pour rejoindre la rébellion et fonder avec Iyad ag Ghali le groupe djihadiste Ansar Dine, devenu RVIM (ou GSIM ou JNIM, selon l’acronyme retenu) à la faveur d’une fusion avec Al Qaïda au Maghreb islamique (Aqmi) et d’autres groupes islamistes.

L’émir historique d’Aqmi, l’Algérien Abdelmalek Droukdel, a lui aussi été tué au cours d’une opération de l’armée française en juin dans le nord du Mali. Le RVIM a libéré début octobre plusieurs otages, dont l’opposant malien Soumaïla Cissé et l’humanitaire française Sophie Pétronin, dans le cadre d’un échange de prisonniers négocié avec Bamako.

Le pouvoir malien souhaite désormais mener des négociations de paix avec la mouvance d’Iyad ag Ghali, malgré les réticences exprimées par la France, qui dispose toujours de plus de 5 000 soldats sur le terrain.",2020-11-13T07:28:51.858Z,2020-11-13T07:28:51.898Z,

Lundi, les principaux syndicats de journalistes et la Ligue des droits de l’homme (LDH) ont dénoncé la proposition de loi sur la « sécurité globale » qui pénaliserait l’usage « malveillant » d’images des forces de l’ordre.

Ce texte controversé, porté par LREM et Agir, est censé consolider les polices municipales et le secteur de la sécurité privée, mais aussi protéger davantage les forces de l’ordre, victimes d’une série d’agressions.

Cette loi implique d'« interdire la diffusion, par tous moyens, de l’image d’un policier, d’un gendarme ou d’un militaire en opération, dans le but de porter atteinte à leur intégrité physique ou psychique », rappelle dans un communiqué l’intersyndicale SNJ, SNJ-CGT, CFDT-Journalistes, SGJ-FO, aux côtés de la LDH et des fédérations internationale et européenne de journalistes.

« Réponse clientéliste »
Mais ce « nouveau délit », punissable d’un an de prison et 45.000 euros d’amende, « a pour objectif réel de restreindre le droit des journalistes et la liberté de la presse de manière disproportionnée par rapport à la réalité de la menace », assurent ces organisations.

« Il permettrait d’interpeller tout journaliste qui filme en direct une opération de police, de le placer en garde à vue » en saisissant son matériel et de « l’envoyer devant un tribunal », seul « à même de déterminer si l’intention malveillante est établie », font-elles valoir.

« Réponse clientéliste du ministère de l’Intérieur à la plupart des syndicats de police », le texte « vise également à empêcher la révélation d’affaires de violences policières illégitimes, souvent dissimulées par la hiérarchie des fonctionnaires en cause », estiment les signataires du communiqué, citant les cas de Geneviève Legay, une manifestante de 73 ans grièvement blessée en 2019 lors d’une charge de police à Nice, et de Cédric Chouviat, livreur mort lors d’un contrôle à Paris en janvier.

Concertation demandée
Outre une « suppression pure et simple » de la mesure, ils appellent le ministère de l’Intérieur et le groupe parlementaire LREM à ouvrir enfin une concertation avec les représentants des journalistes « déjà échaudés » par le « nouveau schéma national du maintien de l’ordre », synonyme pour certains d’entrave à la couverture des manifestations.

Jeudi, le Défenseur des droits avait alerté sur les « risques considérables » d’atteinte à la « liberté d’information » soulevés par le texte sur la « sécurité globale ». Adopté dans la foulée en commission des lois de l’Assemblée nationale, il passera dans l’hémicycle à partir du 17 novembre.",2020-11-13T07:29:49.568Z,2020-11-13T07:29:49.633Z,

Moins d’un an s’est écoulé. Une éternité au regard des évolutions de la politique ivoirienne. Le 21 décembre 2019, Emmanuel Macron fêtait ses 42 ans à l’Hôtel Ivoire d’Abidjan. Le pouvoir ivoirien, maître de cérémonie, était aux anges. L’épouse du chef de l’Etat, Brigitte, pouvait enchaîner quelques pas de danse aux côtés de ceux qui étaient alors des prétendants à la succession d’Alassane Ouattara, le premier ministre, Amadou Gon Coulibaly, et le vice-président, Daniel Kablan Duncan. L’Elysée était encore confiant, sûr que le président de la première puissance économique d’Afrique francophone, comme il l’avait plusieurs fois laissé entendre en aparté à son jeune homologue, tirerait un an plus tard sa révérence à l’issue de son second mandat.

Nouvelle monnaie à l’arrêt
Quelques heures avant les agapes, les deux chefs d’Etat avaient proclamé la mort du franc CFA, « perçu comme l’un des vestiges de la Françafrique », selon M. Macron, et son remplacement par l’éco avant la fin 2020.

La réalité a depuis rattrapé les belles promesses d’hier. La création de la nouvelle monnaie ouest-africaine n’a pas avancé. Le cœur d’Amadou Gon Coulibaly, le seul homme que M. Ouattara souhaitait voir lui succéder, n’a pas tenu. Il est mort le 8 juillet. A 78 ans, alors qu’il avait annoncé en mars sa retraite politique, le président sortant a été réélu le 31 octobre pour un troisième mandat qui suscite controverses et violences.

La « relève générationnelle » tant espérée par l’Elysée attendra

La « relève générationnelle » tant espérée par l’Elysée attendra. La Côte d’Ivoire a renoué avec les tensions politiques qui, depuis près de trente ans, font le malheur de sa population. Incapable de convaincre M. Ouattara de renoncer à sa candidature ou de reporter le scrutin le temps qu’il se trouve un autre successeur, Paris plaide à présent, comme l’ensemble des diplomates africains et occidentaux, pour l’ouverture du jeu politique et « des gestes d’apaisement » à l’égard de l’opposition ivoirienne, dont de nombreuses figures sont désormais en prison ou en exil.

Voies de conciliation
Dès le lendemain du vote, le 1er novembre, Emmanuel Macron a appelé son homologue ivoirien pour lui faire part de « ses inquiétudes sur le niveau inattendu de perturbation du scrutin », à la suite du mot d’ordre de boycott actif de l’opposition, « et l’inciter à prendre la parole au plus vite pour engager le dialogue », indique un décideur français.

C'est le jour où j'ai échappé à la mort."" Ce jour-là en 2015, Lassina Traoré-Tagara, quinquagénaire burkinabé, a appris que ses voisins du dessous étaient des terroristes. Devant son ancien immeuble, à l'angle de la rue Corbillon et de la rue de République, il mime la dernière fois qu'il est entré dans son appartement, le 17 novembre 2015, quelques heures avant l'assaut du Raid qui a mené à la mort d'Abdelhamid Abaaoud, cerveau présumé des attentats du 13 novembre, de sa cousine Hasna Aït Boulahcen et de Chakib Akrouh, leur complice.

""Ce sont eux qui m'ont ouvert"", se souvient-il. En face de lui, Abdelhamid Abaaoud et Chakib Akrouh. ""Je me suis dit que c'était bizarre, parce que je ne les avais jamais vus. Je les appelais 'les étrangers'"", sourit-il nerveusement. Le matin du 18 novembre 2015, aux alentours de 4h30, il est réveillé par une détonation. Croyant à une explosion de gaz, il sort de chez lui, pieds nus et en pyjama, croisant les projecteurs du Raid sur le palier de sa porte. Il est alors exfiltré plusieurs rues plus loin par les forces de l'ordre.

Ce matin-là la vie s'est figée au 48 rue de la République. L'immeuble du centre-ville de Saint-Denis porte encore les stigmates de l'une des plus spectaculaires opérations de l'histoire du Raid. Des planches et des plaques de métal barrent les fenêtres, des vitres brisées n'ont pas été remplacées et des stores restent à moitié descendus.

""Ma vie est en train de reprendre à zéro""
Sur les quelque 48 ménages qui habitaient l'immeuble, trois n'ont toujours pas de logement stable, selon le décompte de la mairie. Ces familles sont hébergées dans des maisons-relais au loyer quasi nul. Les 23 sans-papiers que comptait l'immeuble ont tous obtenu un titre de séjour, renouvelable tous les ans. Plusieurs d'entre eux ont vécu des mois, voire plusieurs années dans des hôtels avant de trouver une situation pérenne.

C'est le cas de Lassina Traoré-Tagara. ""Ça a été un long parcours"", confie-t-il. Arrivé en France en 2010, ce musicien ambitieux avait l'espoir de vivre de sa passion. En attendant d'accomplir son rêve, il était sans-papiers et faisait la plonge dans des restaurants ou de la manutention dans des garages. Après l'assaut, il a passé plusieurs diplômes pour finalement devenir aide-foreur sur le chantier du futur Pôle des métiers d'arts Chanel à Aubervilliers (Seine-Saint-Denis). Depuis le mois de mars 2019, il habite dans un T2 à Stains, à quelques kilomètres de son lieu de travail. Entre temps, il a connu la faim et la honte.
Certains jours, il n'a que de l'eau à se mettre dans l'estomac. Même ""un café était devenu un luxe"". Parfois, il arrivait qu'on me reconnaisse dans le métro et que des gens me donnent un peu d'argent. Je ne voulais même pas accepter parce que j'avais honte de moi, c'était très difficile…"" Aujourd'hui, ""ça va mieux"", tandis que sa vie ""est seulement en train de reprendre à zéro"". Lassina n'a jamais pu remettre les pieds dans son ancien appartement ni récupérer ses affaires. L'immeuble est condamné par un arrêté de péril pour insalubrité.

""On se fait spolier gentiment""
Le syndicat des copropriétaires de l'immeuble regrette cette situation et met en cause la Sorêqa, un aménageur public qui travaille avec la mairie. ""La Sorêqa a racheté l'immeuble pour 1 700 euros le mètre carré. Il faut voir combien il coûte en réalité"", grince Florian Tosoni, l'avocat du syndicat de copropriétaires. A Saint-Denis, le mètre carré pour un appartement est évalué autour de 3 900 euros. A cette adresse, il tombe toutefois à 2 500 euros.

""L'immeuble n'est pas un repaire de brigands comme on a pu l'entendre"", poursuit Florian Tosoni. ""Ce n'était pas Versailles, mais ce n'était pas un taudis non plus"", appuie un propriétaire, qui souhaite garder l'anonymat. ""Il y avait trois ou quatre squats sur la quarantaine de lots"", selon lui. Aujourd'hui, les copropriétaires s'acquittent encore de charges pour cet immeuble dans lequel ils ne peuvent plus mettre un pied. ""On continue à payer des charges de copropriété et on nous envoie tous les ans la taxe foncière, assure le propriétaire à franceinfo. Il affirme en outre que les planches qui barrent les fenêtres leur ont été facturées.
Avec l'arrivée du village olympique dans la ville en 2024, le propriétaire estime que l'immeuble, au pied de la basilique Saint-Denis et à quelques enjambées du Stade de France, possède plusieurs atouts, qui intéressent la mairie. Pour lui, une plus-value immobilière est en train de se faire sur leurs dos. ""On se fait spolier gentiment"", soupçonne-t-il.

La mairie confirme l'opération. ""Les copropriétaires ont été expropriés"", assume Katy Bontinck, première adjointe au maire PS de Saint-Denis. ""C'est une procédure entamée depuis fin 2018 avec Sorêqa en lien avec la Ville pour traiter l'habitat indigne"", justifie-t-elle. La Sorêqa rachète l'immeuble ""à l'amiable, lot par lot"". Quand la Sorêqa ""sera propriétaire dans quelques mois, on pourra lancer la démolition et reconstruction d'un nouveau programme immobilier"", déroule l'adjointe. Projet qui pourrait voir le jour ""mi 2023"".

Assignation en justice contre l'Etat
En attendant, Florian Tosoni espère que les copropriétaires pourront bientôt bénéficier d'une indemnisation pour le préjudice subi, reconnu en 2016. Ils réclament ""environ 500 à 600 000 euros TTC pour les parties privatives et communes"", mais le premier rapport d'expert mandaté par la chancellerie ""avait oublié d'inclure la TVA"". ""Et encore, je ne parle que du préjudice matériel et pas du préjudice moral"", ajoute-t-il. Très peu d'occupants ont été indemnisés à ce titre.

Parmi eux, la famille qui habitait au 3e étage, en face de l'appartement occupé par Abaaoud. Claudette Eleini qui représente la famille a obtenu ""une indemnisation du préjudice psychologique environ trois ans après les faits"". Ce foyer, composé d'un couple avec un enfant et une grand-mère, ""a accepté une provision de 5 000 euros, il y a un an, pour le petit de 5 ans à l'époque"", explique l'avocate. ""Si nous l'avions obtenu dès le début"", l'argent aurait pu financer un suivi psychologique pour l'enfant, traumatisé. ""Il dort toutes les nuits avec sa grand-mère, il fait encore pipi au lit…"", souffle Claudette Eleini.

Le combat judiciaire de la famille n'est pas terminé. Désormais locataire, toujours à Saint-Denis, le ménage espère obtenir la prise en charge de ses loyers. ""Je viens de lancer une assignation à l'Etat pour prise en charge des loyers que mes clients payent depuis mars 2016 et privation de jouissance de leur appartement et de leurs effets personnels"", explique Claudette Eleini. Elle estime que ses clients ont perdu plus de 160 000 euros dans cette affaire.

""Ils ont vécu deux heures de champs de bataille""
Malgré leurs fortunes diverses, les habitants ont en commun de vouloir être reconnus comme des victimes du terrorisme. Cela fait même partie des réclamations portées par l'association des sinistrés depuis novembre 2015. ""Nous demandions la régularisation des sans-papiers de l'immeuble, le relogement de l'ensemble des habitants et la reconnaissance du statut de victime du terrorisme"", égrène Marie Huiban, militante du Droit au logement (DAL), qui a œuvré à la création d'un collectif.
La question des victimes collatérales du terrorisme n'est ""pas prise en compte"", selon Marie Huiban. ""Ils ont vécu deux heures de champs de bataille avec des tirs au-dessus de leurs têtes, quand même. Il ne serait pas trop tard pour leur accorder le statut de victime du terrorisme.""

""Oui, on veut toujours obtenir ce statut, acquiesce Lassina. C'était des terroristes recherchés sur le plan international ! La reconnaissance de l'intervention de police de l'Etat, ce n'est pas assez fort. Comme c'est à Saint-Denis, ils se disent que c'est des immigrés, déplore-t-il. Vous pensez que si ça c'était passé à Paris, cela aurait été pareil ?""",2020-11-13T07:33:27.892Z,2020-11-13T07:33:27.956Z,

При этом обладающие ядерным оружием страны продолжают модернизировать его или заявляют о таких намерениях
Общее количество ядерного оружия в мире сокращается, однако обладающие им страны продолжают его модернизировать, говорится в докладе Стокгольмского международного института исследования проблем мира (СИПРИ).

«Ключевым выводом является то, что, несмотря на общее сокращение числа ядерных боеголовок в 2018 году, все ядерные державы продолжают модернизировать свои арсеналы», — завил бывший заместитель генсека ООН, председатель правления института Ян Элиассон.

Как отмечается, на Россию и США в совокупности приходится более 90% всего ядерного оружия. В обеих странах реализуются дорогостоящие программы по замене и модернизации ядерных боеголовок, ракетных и авиационных систем их доставки, указывается в докладе.
Авторы документа напомнили, что договор между Москвой и Вашингтоном о мерах по дальнейшему сокращению и ограничению стратегических наступательных вооружений (СНВ-2) истечет в 2021 году, если стороны не согласятся продлить его. «Перспективы продолжения согласованного сокращения российских и американских ядерных сил становятся все менее вероятными с учетом политических и военных разногласий между двумя странами», — заявил директор программы СИПРИ по ядерному разоружению Шеннон Кайл.

Всего в мире на начало 2018 года существует девять ядерных стран: Россия, США, Великобритания, Израиль, Индия, Китай, КНДР, Пакистан и Франция. Все они обладают 13 865 единицами ядерного оружия, тогда как на начало прошлого года эта цифра составляла 14 465 единиц, указывается в докладе. При этом 2 тыс. из них находятся в состоянии боеготовности, а 3750 развернуты в оперативных частях. Как указывает СИПРИ, ядерные арсеналы других стран значительно меньше, чем у России и США, однако все они либо уже разрабатывают и размещают новые системы, либо объявили о намерении сделать это.

В конце мая директор Совета национальной безопасности США Тим Моррисон сообщил, что президент Дональд Трамп примет решение о том, продлевать ли Договор о сокращении и ограничении стратегических наступательных вооружений (СНВ-3) в 2020 году. При этом СМИ со ссылкой на источники писали, что американский лидер поручил своей администрации подготовить почву для заключения в дальнейшем с Москвой и Пекином нового соглашения о контроле над ядерными вооружениями.

Первый договор СНВ начал действовать в 1994 году и истек в 2009-м. В 2010 году бывшие президенты России и США Дмитрий Медведев и Барак Обама подписали новый договор, который вступил в силу в 2011 году.

Представители Росморречфлота, Ространснадзора, перевозчиков, объектов транспортной инфраструктуры, рыболовецких предприятий обсудили недавно принятые постановления и те изменения в практической работе отрасли, которые они вызовут.

Заместитель начальника Управления транспортной безопасности Росморречфлота Валерий Капралов рассказал о подготовке паспортов обеспечения транспортной безопасности (ОТБ), планов ОТБ для судов, выполняющих международные перевозки и о процедурах ОТБ на участках внутренних водных путей и в акваториях морских портов. Говоря о паспортах ОТБ, Валерий Капралов отметил, что новые НПА меняют баланс полномочий: они сокращены для уполномоченного органа — Росморречфлота — и расширены для субъектов транспортной инфраструктуры (СТИ). По его словам, ответственность за подготовку и утверждение паспортов ОТБ лежит на СТИ, агентство же собирает сведения, получаемые от участников рынка и вносит их в единую государственную информационную систему обеспечения транспортной безопасности (ЕГИС ОТБ) для дальнейшего использования ее контрольно-надзорным органом (Ространснадзором).

Валерий Капралов отметил, что за ОТБ акваторий портов и участков внутренних водных путей отвечают соответственно капитаны портов во взаимодействии с территориальными управлениями Росморпорта и администрации бассейнов внутренних водных путей. Причем для портовых акваторий необходима разработка планов ОТБ, хотя они и являются объектами, не подлежащими категорированию. В отношении ТС, выполняющих международные рейсы, также должны разрабатываться планы ОТБ на основе результатов проведенной оценки уязвимости.

Замначальника Управления транспортной безопасности Росморречфлота ответил на вопрос участников о необходимости проведения повторной оценки уязвимости. Также он сообщил, что агентство в сотрудничестве с аккредитованными организациями в области транспортной безопасности готовит рекомендации по подготовке акта обследования и заполнению типовых паспортов ОТБ, которые будут опубликованы на сайте Росморречфлота в разделе «Транспортная безопасность».

Алексей Аладьин, начальник отдела транспортной безопасности компании «ВодоходЪ», обратил внимание участников дискуссии на неясные моменты в  приказе Минтранса РФ №377 , который изменяет порядок ведения реестра объектов транспортной инфраструктуры и транспортных средств. Он упомянул вводимую для СТИ возможность подготовки планов ОТБ на группу однотипных объектов, например, судов одного класса и выразил мнение, что, поскольку планы ОТБ необходимо менять при любом изменении в параметрах плана, например, при смене ответственного лица, такой «групповой план» создаст для СТИ больше проблем, чем преимуществ. Также Алексей Аладьин высказался по поводу требования о создании пункта управления транспортной безопасностью, в функции которого входит, в том числе, оперативное реагирование и информирование компетентных органов о поступающих с ТС сигналов. Применительно к практике «Водохода» — крупной компании, организующей круизы и владеющей 26 круизными лайнерами — это означает, что будет необходимо в рамках компании создать круглосуточно действующее подразделение, которое будет выполнять функции ситуационного центра.

Начальник отдела транспортной безопасности компании «ВодоходЪ» подчеркнул, что изменение критериев ОТБ ведет к необходимости переоснащения или дополнительного оснащения судов техническими средствами обеспечения транспортной безопасности (ТС ОТБ). Он привел пример с изменением критерия количества людей, находящихся в помещении, для того, чтобы оно рассматривалось как место массового пребывания, которое необходимо оснащать видеонаблюдением. Раньше этот критерий составлял 50 человек, и суда оборудовались исходя из этой нормы. Сейчас критерий снижен до 10 человек, что вызывает необходимость на каждом круизном лайнере установить порядка 10 дополнительных видеокамер, обеспечивающих мониторинг мест с массовым пребыванием. Также Алексей Аладьин отметил возможные технические проблемы при оснащении судов техническими средствами ОТБ. Например,  установку  СКУД вряд ли удастся согласовать с органами технического надзора.

Заместитель начальника отдела внутреннего аудита ПАО «Совкомфлот» Андрей Иванов согласился с позицией о затратности нововведений по оснащению техсредствами, включая средства досмотра, и отметил, что деятельность «Совкомфлота» связана в том числе с перевозкой горючих и взрывоопасных углеводородов, что вызывает необходимость использовать ТС ОТБ во взрывозащищенном и пожаробезопасном исполнении, а это более дорогое оборудование, чем используемое на пассажирских судах.

Советник руководителя Ространснадзора Владимир Черток прокомментировал ряд пунктов новых постановлений, на которые СТИ должны обратить особое внимание. По его словам, в деятельности федеральных агентств по видам транспорта и Ространснадзора происходит усиление роли электронного документооборота и дистанционных механизмов контроля. Для СТИ это означает, что переданные в агентство сведения паспортов ОТБ и другая информация будут вноситься в ЕГИС ОТБ и использоваться надзорными органами при проведении проверок. Упрощенные, неполные или некорректные данные паспортов могут стать причиной санкций со стороны Ространснадзора. Владимир Черток также затронул тему ТСОТБ и изменение требований к ним, обратив внимание на то, что техсредства должны обеспечивать не только фиксацию, но и хранение информации на протяжении установленного законодательством срока.

Минтранс, как отметил советник главы Ространснадзора, намерен анализировать правоприменительную практику, обобщать ее и в установленные постановлениями сроки доложить Правительству РФ результаты мониторинга, с тем, чтобы иметь возможность скорректировать принятые положения, вызывающие неоднозначную реакцию, и улучшать правовую среду в сфере ОТБ.
Специалист по транспортной безопасности АО «Рыболовецкий колхоз «Восток-1» Владимир Хомик вынес на обсуждение вопрос о месте проведения досмотра, который СТИ в соответствии с требованиями закона, должны проводить на борту судна. Он выразил мнение, что для выполнения некоторых процедур, например, обнаружения запрещенных к перевозке веществ, взрывчатки, ядов, токсинов, биологических агентов — это требование невыполнимо: на открытом воздухе, при сильном ветре, в дождь газоанализаторы и обнаружители могут сработать некорректно. Такую процедуру лучше проводить в закрытом помещении. Это можно организовать в порту, тем более, что при проходе в порт досмотровые процедуры также являются обязательными, а на борту судна они лишь дублируются. Снятие с СТИ требования на проведение еще одного досмотра, на борту судна, позволило бы, по мнению Владимира Хомика, существенно облегчить работу.

С детальным анализом спорных положений ПП №№ 1637, 1638 и 1651 выступил заместитель директора по режиму и транспортной безопасности АО «Пассажирский Порт Санкт-Петербург «Морской фасад» Александр Олейник. В своем выступлении он указал на неоднозначность трактовок и расплывчатость формулировок  положений закона. Например, ОТИ обязан создать или привлечь надлежащим образом оснащенное  техническими средствами ПТБ для обеспечения безопасности на объекте. ОТИ, в соответствии с требованиями закона, несет ответственность за неисполнение или некачественное исполнение требований по ОТБ на объекте. Если выяснится, что техническая оснащенность привлеченного ПТБ не отвечает действующим требованиям, ответственность будет нести ОТИ. По мнению Александра Олейника, такая асимметрия должна быть устранена. Он также высказал целый ряд предложений по совершенствованию и гармонизации законодательства и выразил надежду, что позиция профессионального сообщества будет более полно учитываться при подготовке изменений в законах.

В завершение дискуссии выступил заместитель начальника Управления транспортной безопасности Ространснадзора Александр Хуртин. Он ответил на ряд вопросов, возникших у аудитории в ходе обсуждения. Так, он ответил на неоднократно задаваемый вопрос о возможности введения моратория на подготовку паспортов ОТБ. По его словам, Ространснадзор не имеет полномочий на введение моратория. Действующее законодательство требует подготовить паспорта ОТБ в течение месяца, и это требование необходимо выполнять. Ространснадзор, как отметил Александр Хуртин, рекомендует ОТИ и СТИ ответственно подойти к их подготовке.

Дополнительная оценка уязвимости, по словам докладчика, должна проводиться в двух случаях: при изменении технологического процесса и при изменении требований законодательства. Соответственно, появление новых требований вызывает необходимость проведения дополнительной оценки. Еще одним вопросом, который затронул замглавы Управления транспортной безопасности Ространснадзора, стало расширение круга контролируемых лиц. Кроме СТИ, перевозчиков и застройщиков, Ространснадзор будет контролировать ПТБ, учебные центры и аттестующие организации.",2020-11-13T07:39:18.390Z,2020-11-13T07:39:18.558Z,

Об этом передаёт ИА «Туркменистан сегодня».

Двухдневная встреча была организована в рамках проекта «Морская защита, безопасность и охрана окружающей среды черноморского и каспийского регионов» (BCSEA), реализуемого EMSA (Европейское агентство морской безопасности) при финансовой поддержке Евросоюза.

Основной целью проекта является ознакомление туркменских специалистов с международной практикой, приведение нормативно-правовой базы прибрежных стран в соответствие с законодательством ЕС.

Данный проект охватывает такие страны, как Туркменистан, Азербайджан, Грузия, Иран, Казахстан, Молдову, Турцию и Украину.
— Выгодное географическое расположение Туркменистана обуславливает его укрепляющийся статус важного транзитно-транспортного узла Евразии, — отметили представители туркменской стороны.

Отметим, Туркменистан вместе с зарубежными партнёрами выполняет крупные проекты по созданию комбинированной региональной и межрегиональной логистической системы, формированию межгосударственных транзитных коридоров, связывающих ЦА и Европу, Каспийский, Черноморский и Балтийский регионы, Средний и Ближний Восток, Южную и Юго-Восточную Азию.

Сфера транспорта является одним из основных сегментов мировой экономики, оказывающим действие на стабильность и сбалансированность мирохозяйственных связей, реализацию глобальных ЦУР.

— Мы предлагаем рассмотреть вопрос обеспечения стабильных международных перевозок в период ЧС. Подготовлен соответствующий проект резолюции Генассамблеи, который направлен на рассмотрение государств-членов ООН, — сказал туркменский лидер в своём видеообращении к участникам 75-й сессии ГА ООН.

В завершении встречи стороны подчеркнули, что развитие Туркменистаном международного сотрудничества в области морского транспорта в современных условиях является подтверждением эффективности госполитики, проводимой в этой сфере и направленной на расширение экономического взаимодействия

The snapshot released by officials this week provides a glimpse of the work of nearly 2,100 uniformed agents from six line stations — Imperial Beach, Chula Vista, El Cajon, Brown Field, Campo and Boulevard — and two interior stations in Murrieta and San Clemente.

The agents operate along 60 miles of land border with Mexico and patrol 114 miles of coastal border.

“These results are a direct testament to the heart and soul of our agents,” Chief Patrol Agent Aaron M. Heitke said in a statement. “In the midst of turmoil, uncertainty and even global pandemic, our agents show up and get the job done.”

According to a highlights list released Monday, the agency’s San Diego sector apprehended 53,282 people who entered the U.S. illegally from Oct. 1, 2019 to Sept. 30, 2020 — about an 8 percent decline from the previous year.

Not only did agents apprehend fewer people, but the demographics of those arrested changed dramatically from the previous year, with those detained increasingly being single male adults rather than families and children, said agency spokesman Jeffrey Stephenson.

Apprehensions of unaccompanied juveniles — 1,855 — was down by 44 percent from the previous year, while the number of family units encountered dropped nearly 70 percent from the previous year. The agency apprehended 3,335 unaccompanied children and 16,174 family units during fiscal year 2019, Stephenson said.

Border Patrol officials said the shift in those illegally entering the country came after policies and agreements put in place by the Trump administration allowed Border Patrol agents to “expeditiously” return people to their home countries and encouraged potential asylum seekers to claim asylum in the first safe place outside their home country.

Some asylum seekers have filed lawsuits challenging the “Remain in Mexico” program, officially known as Migrant Protection Protocols, which require most asylum seekers from Latin American countries to wait in Mexico while their immigration court cases progress in the U.S. One of the complaints filed argues that the program requires asylum seekers to stay in dangerous situations that prevent them from having access to information they need to successfully present their cases to immigration judges.

The mix of drugs coming across the border also changed, Border Patrol officials said.

There was a drop in cocaine and heroin seizures in the San Diego sector over the past fiscal year, but the region saw an 83 percent jump in methamphetamine seizures and a 255 percent increase in fentanyl seizures.

Agents seized 10,828 pounds of marijuana, which is a 230 percent jump from the previous year. Officials believe drug smugglers are moving a lot more meth, fentanyl and marijuana because those products are the most profitable for them.

In the past year, agents saw more people trying to illegally cross the border by water, often cramming many people into pangas, low-slung Mexican fishing boats. Some tried to swim across the border or used personal watercraft.

Three years ago, the agency reported 129 maritime events and 347 arrests. That jumped to 309 maritime events this past year, with 1,273 apprehensions.

Officials say maritime smuggling is especially dangerous because it involves overcrowding people into boats, often with inadequate food and water, no lighting and no safety vests.

On the plus side, there were fewer assaults reported against agents — 54 — which was a 65 percent drop from the previous year. Officials attributed that decrease to new border wall construction, which they say included replacing walls that were dilapidated and ineffectively designed and adding barriers were none previously existed.",2020-11-13T08:06:38.969Z,2020-11-13T08:06:39.035Z,
181,https://thetaiwantimes.com/chinas-maritime-aggression-fuelling-asias-submarine-race/6879,China’s Maritime Aggression Fuelling Asia’s Submarine Race,"China’s relentless naval modernisation combined with its maritime aggression in the waters of the East China Sea and the South China Sea is pushing its neighbours to invest in one platform which has the potential to undercut the world’s largest navy.

Across South and East Asia, China’s neighbours are buying the diesel-electric submarines, which can capitalise on the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) known vulnerability in anti-submarine warfare, even as it has spent billions of dollars in military up-gradation.

Leading this pack are Taiwan, Japan and Australia.

This week, on November 3, Taiwan began gearing up to begin construction on the first of its indigenously designed diesel-electric attack submarines.

The country is aiming to deploy eight new submarines under its “Indigenous Defense Submarine” (IDS) project.

The first of the submarines under this project is expected to be ready for launch in the third quarter of 2024 at the earliest and will be sent to the Navy for sea trials in 2025.

Simultaneously, Taiwan is also launching a programme early next year to upgrade its existing Chien Lung-class submarine fleet, which will be completed by 2024.

These submarines were manufactured in the late 1980s in the Netherlands for Taiwan.
Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has repeatedly underlined the significance of the submarine fleet in the country’s defence planning.

In recent years, Taipei has faced unrelenting aggression from the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA), which has deployed its military assets around Taiwan. As a result, Taipei has been left with no choice but to upgrade its submarine fleet to deter the PLA.
The programme is ambitious but has received support from the United States and its allies.

In 2018, the U.S. State Department approved licenses for U.S. defence companies to sell submarine technology to Taiwan which would enable closer collaboration between the two countries on submarine construction.

Similarly, for the IDS project, South Korean engineers have chipped in.

Taiwan is a representative example of the emergent underwater race in Asia as countries respond to China’s maritime aggression to assert its territorial claims in the South China Sea and the East China Sea.

China has deployed a massive battery of surface to air missiles, installed radar domes, and stationed anti-ship missiles in the disputed islands in the South China Sea.

Likewise, it has also been resorting to intrusions into the territorial waters of its neighbours.

On October 11, the Japanese Coast Guard revealed that two Chinese Coast Guard ships had illegally entered into the country’s territorial waters off Senkaku islands in the East China Sea.

Reportedly this was the longest intrusion into the waters in eight years since Japan’s government’s purchase of some of the Senkaku Islands in 2012.

Such aggressions have been on the rise since 2010, according to the data released by the Japanese Foreign Ministry.

This along with the PLA’s naval modernisation has prompted the wary government to increase its submarine fleet from 16 to 22, under its 2010 National Defense Program Guidelines.

The country has already achieved that target – the 22nd vessel, a Taigei-class submarine built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., which was unveiled on October 14.
It is scheduled to go into service in March 2022.  The country has plans for two more Taigei-class submarines.

Another powerful navy in the region, Australia too has embarked on the largest defence procurement programme in Australia’s history, costing more than $90 Billion, which would double its submarine fleet.

For this, it has partnered with France’s Naval Group (earlier the DCNS), which would give the Royal Australian Navy 12 submarines in the Attack class.
Construction on the first ship of the class is expected to start in 2022, and its delivery is slated to take place in the early 2030s.

Not just big navies, smaller navies too are building up submarine capabilities, despite funding constraints.

Indonesia, whose Global Maritime Axis strategy crossed with China’ Maritime Silk Route, is in the process of acquiring three diesel-electric submarines from South Korea.

Similarly, Vietnam, which has faced relentless PLA aggression in the South China Sea, has in recent years acquired six Kilo-class submarines from Russia, deployed at Cam Ranh Bay.

Besides, it has also announced plans to build an indigenous submarine, to replace the Yugo-class midget submarines in service.

With this powerful submarine fleet, Hanoi hopes to counter the PLA’s tactics of using coast guard and maritime militia vessels to blockade access to Vietnamese-held islands.

This submarine race in the region decisively demonstrates that China’s neighbours are unwilling to tolerate Beijing’s bullying tactics, especially when it is deploying state of the art military equipment around the disputed territories to coerce the smaller countries.
Acquisition of submarines gives them the requisite potent counter-punch against the Chinese capabilities and one which can slip past the Chinese defences.

It’s time Beijing realises that its coercion is only going to force its neighbours into acquiring more lethal military capabilities.",2020-11-13T08:08:18.774Z,2020-11-13T08:08:19.000Z,

Strong winds had pushed the three platforms all the way to Kinmen, close to the coast of China’s province of Fujian, CNA reported. The Coast Guard spotted them near the construction site of the bridge between the Taiwanese islands of Kinmen and Little Kinmen but found nobody on board and no danger of pollution.

Meanwhile, a destroyer made a transit of the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday.

USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76) and its strike group passed through the Strait of Malacca and entered the South China Sea on Monday, according to ship spotters. Accompanying the carrier was guided-missile cruiser USS Antietam (CG-54) and destroyer USS Halsey (DDG-97).

“While in the South China Sea, the strike group is conducting maritime security operations, which include flight operations with fixed and rotary wing aircraft, maritime strike exercises, and coordinated tactical training between surface and air units,” read a statement from U.S. 7th Fleet.

Prior to arriving in the South China Sea, Reagan was operating in the Indian Ocean before returning through the strait. The strike group had previously operated in the region in mid-August. Reagan embarked with Carrier Air Wing 5 in June from its homeport in Yokosuka, Japan.
USS Barry (DDG-52) passed through the strait on Wednesday, a first for a U.S. warship since Aug. 31. “The ship’s transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,” read the statement.

According to Beijing, Chinese forces monitored the U.S. destroyer during its transit.

“We warn the U.S. to stop its words and deeds that provoke trouble and disturb the situation in the Taiwan Strait,” military spokesman Col. Zhang Chunhui said on Thursday.

The destroyer’s transit and Reagan’s follow a freedom of navigation operation by USS John McCain (DDG-56) off the Paracel Islands earlier this month. Chinese officials protested McCain’s transit past the islands at the time.

“We demand the U.S. immediately stop such provocative actions, (and) strictly control and restrict military operations in the sea and air,” the People’s Liberation Army said in a statement, according to Reuters.",2020-11-13T08:37:44.423Z,2020-11-13T08:37:44.511Z,

McCain (DDG 56) conducted live-fire surface and air exercises in the Bay of Bengal as part of exercise Malabar while USS Curtis Wilbur (DDG 54), in the Philippine Sea, joined the Royal Canadian Navy Halifax-class frigate HMCS Winnipeg (FFH 338) during a live-fire surface engagement exercise.

“Today’s simultaneous live fire events in two different oceans across the theater are example of the lethality we bring to bear alongside our strategic allies and partners in the region,” said Capt. Steven DeMoss, commodore, Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 15.

McCain joined ships from the Indian Navy, Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF), and Royal Australian Navy (RAN) for a coordinated live-fire air gunnery exercise, targeting a towed aerial target, followed by a similar surface engagement during scheduled events for Malabar.

On the same morning, more than 3,000 miles away, Curtis Wilbur joined HMCS Winnipeg of the Royal Canadian Navy during a live-fire gunnery exercise to engage an unmanned, remote-operated surface target.

“We were able to test and train our close-in weapon system (CIWS), 25mm machine gun and .50-caliber machine gun operators,” said Ensign William Lee, gunnery officer of USS Curtis Wilbur. “Being able to test those capabilities as well as our crew’s abilities against a moving surface target was a great opportunity.”

Exercises such as these allow for practical training while exchanging skills and cultures and increasing understanding of multinational operations.

“Australia, Canada, India, and Japan are key strategic allies and partners and critical stakeholders to upholding stability and regional security,” said DeMoss. “Together, our job is to be ready – now and always – to bring as much responsive, flexible, enduring, and overwhelming force as we can, to any situation where force is required.”

Participants in both exercises include USS John S. McCain (DDG 56), USS Curtis Wilbur (DDG 54), along with Indian Navy Ships Shakti (A57), Ranvijay (D55), Shivalik (F47), HMAS Ballarat (FFG 155), from the RAN, JS Ōnami (DD 111) from the JMSDF, and HMCS Winnipeg (FFH 338) from the Royal Canadian Navy.

“This interdiction operation was conducted in order to prevent the possible entry and exit of illicit drugs in Iloilo City,” said PDEA-6 Spokesperson Ma. Graziella Tanaleon.

The PDEA-6 Seaport Interdiction Unit (SUI) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) Maritime Unit have been randomly inspecting three different fast crafts that ferry passengers between Iloilo City and Bacolod City.

“Inbound and outbound packages were subjected to K9 inspection by narcotics detection dog (NDD) Ellana and her handler. No dangerous drugs were found during the inspection,” Tanaleon noted.

Early this month, sea trips between Iloilo and Bacolod resumed after almost three months of travel suspension as both cities were battling high cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Meanwhile, PDEA-6 vowed it will continue its mandate despite the challenges posed by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

One containership has partially sunk and two lost cargo in storm conditions off north and west Europe and off the US west coast.

In the northern Pacific, a deepsea large containership has reported damage to at least 100 containers.

ONE Aquila suffered collapsed containers due to severe weather conditions while it was sailing from China to Long Beach, California.

Ocean Network Express (ONE) confirmed the ship changed cause after loss of the container stacks to Port of Tacoma, near Seattle, for an emergency survey, repairs and discharge of the collapsed containers.

“After completion of the discharge operations and repair works, the vessel is to continue its voyage as per its original service rotation,” said ONE in a statement.

ONE Aquila is now due at Long Beach on 26 November and Oakland on 4 December 2020, subject to the progress of operations at Port of Tacoma.

Off Portugal, 1998-built containership Southwester issued distress signals on 5 November after flooding in the engineroom.

There was risk the ship could capsize and sink, although the Portugal Maritime Safety Authority said this Vanuatu-flagged, 5,400-dwt ship was still afloat.

The authority said two tugs were contracted to tow this maritime casualty to a safe port.

Flooding occurred around 30 nautical miles off Figueira da Foz, Portugal, as Southwester was sailing from northwest France to Seville, Spain.

According to Maritime Bulletin, 14 crew on board were rescued by a nearby cargo ship.

Also in Europe, more than 30 containers were lost from a ship in a storm off Scotland.

UK coastguard responded to Dutch cargo ship Francisca after it reported the loss of 33 containers as it passed Pentland Firth en route from Iceland to Rotterdam.

Her Majesty’s Coastguard said it sent an emergency towage vessel and an aircraft to assist Francisca on 2 November. Northern Lighthouse Board and the aircraft were assisting in the search for the lost containers, of which two were reported ashore in South Hoy in the Orkney Islands.

It is thought other containers on Francisca could be in danger of falling overboard.

Also this week, HM Coastguard dispatched emergency towing vessel, Ievoli Black, on 2 November, to assist a cargo vessel that reported engine problems north west of the Shetland Isles.

Crew on this cargo ship completed repairs and the vessel proceeded on its voyage.

However, cargo ship Sema was less fortunate as it sailed along the Don Sea Canal in Russia.

According to Fleetmon, Sema grounded while en route to Turkey from Rostov with a cargo of millet on 3 November. Tugs were mobilised to refloat the vessel.

In Mexico, tugs will be required to refloat a former cruise ship and offshore accommodation vessel after it grounded during its tow to a dismantling shipyard in Tampico.

Enchanted Capri (ex-cruise ship Azerbaijan) has been used as an offshore floatel in the Gulf of Mexico since 2009, but was sent to lay-up this year.

It was decommissioned and was being towed from lay-up to a scrapyard with a skeleton crew of four on board.

According to Fleetmon, Enchanted Capri, was anchored during a storm and waiting for weather to improve, but its anchor dragged and the ships was grounded.

Tugs will be mobilised to refloat the ship and tow it to the decommissioning shipyard.",2020-11-13T08:40:00.042Z,2020-11-13T08:40:00.117Z,
187,https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/number-small-fishing-vessels-smuggling-illegal-drugs-has-tripled-180976157/,The Number of Small Fishing Vessels Smuggling Illegal Drugs Has Tripled A lack of options for commercial fishermen in coastal communities has led to a boom in trafficking,"The story of how illegal drugs make their way across the ocean often starts with a failing or banned fishing fleet in a marginalized coastal community. The reasons vary, but depleted seafood stocks from overfishing in areas of Asia, polluted waters in the Gulf of Guinea in West Africa, and the declaration of a new marine protected area in the Caribbean have all stopped fishers from earning their livelihood and sparked some vessels to turn to shipping illicit substances, according to an international team of researchers who recently analyzed drug busts.

According to a September study in Fish and Fisheries, the use of small fishing vessels to smuggle illegal drugs is on the rise across the world as traffickers seek to take advantage of porous borders and the relatively murky laws governing international waters. The use of small vessels has tripled in the past eight years to represent about 15 percent of the total global retail value of illegal drugs. “The fishing sector is increasingly a vector for transporting drugs,” says Dyhia Belhabib, principal investigator with Ecotrust Canada, a nonprofit organization working to build a conservation-based economy and the lead author of the study.

Belhabib first became interested in conducting a study during a trip to Guinea-Bissau, where she heard that small boats were being used to smuggle drugs as part of the country’s major trafficking problem. She later began working on the study as part of a larger project called Spyglass. The publicly available database collects criminal records of sea vessels from law enforcement officials, media and other sources as an effort to increase the visibility of repeat offenders and improve international policing. The platform, hosted by Ecotrust Canada, is intended to help officials, nongovernmental organizations and others track and sanction high-risk vessels.

Ife Okafor-Yarwood, a lecturer in sustainable development at the University of St. Andrews in the U.K. who wasn’t involved in Belhabib’s study, says Spyglass is a helpful tool that is easy to navigate for researchers and the general public. “Spyglass can be a useful tool for maritime law enforcements,” she says, “especially in countries where the monitoring control and surveillance capability is weak as they can use it to track a vessels history of violations and other fisheries related crime.”

International waters are notoriously lawless, and vessels of all sizes are often suspected of involvement in crimes such as illegal fishing, human trafficking, onboard slavery and murder. The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime noted in a report that drug trafficking was linked to illegal fishing, but Belhabib wanted to verify this by looking at the record.

For the study, Belhabib and her colleagues analyzed 292 cases from media reports, press releases and reports from governments and other sources on trends and patterns, looking for evidence of drug busts in six languages: English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, French and Chinese. They first took the number of apprehended vessels and determined the value of the drugs onboard. They then ran models to estimate how many vessels—detected and undetected—were involved in illicit trade over time, and what portion of the overall drug trade their cargoes represented using figures from the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime.

In a report by Global Financial Integrity, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank that produces analysis of illicit finances, the researchers calculated that illicit drug revenue smuggled by fishing vessels around the world amounted to $80 billion a year, or about 15 percent of the $426 billion to $652 billion yearly revenue brought in by drugs worldwide.

Belhabib estimates that an individual vessel can bring in up to $70 million worth of drugs in a single shipment. But her team also found that the average size of an individual shipment is getting smaller over time, even as the overall amount of drugs shipped by these vessels is increasing. What this means in practice is that traffickers are splitting larger shipments so if one boat is caught by authorities, the traffickers don’t lose as much.. This small-boat strategy is particularly adaptable for cartels, she says. “They have multiple strategies to avoid getting caught and multiple strategies to lower the risk of losing a lot if they do get caught,” Belhabib says.

As opposed to what was previously surmised about drug smuggling’s connection to illegal fishing, Belhabib’s research didn’t show much of a link. She believes that traffickers might see vessels with clean records as less likely to get searched by law enforcement than high-risk, repeat offenders. Or that fishing enforcement officers may be missing the elephant in the room, as many fisheries law agents are trained to look for illegal catch rather than hidden drugs. “To be honest I think it’s a mixture of both,” she says.

Aldo Chircop, Canada Research Chair in maritime law and policy at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia who was not involved in Belhabib’s study, says that the international community has trouble enough policing large vessels in international waters. But the monitoring and policing of small fishing boats is nearly impossible, even in a relatively rich country like Canada. He says that larger vessels fishing in North Atlantic waters often carry official observers, but small boats carry aren’t subject to that much oversight. While small boats may be occasionally subject to fisheries inspections, these officers aren’t trained to look for drugs. “I can understand how this might slip under the radar,” Chircop says. “Even providing basic search and rescue support for these vessels is a real challenge.”

The use of recreational yachts adds to the porousness of maritime borders, especially since private yachts and small fishing boats often come into all types of small ports lacking the type of monitoring occurring at the bigger harbors. “[Small fishing boats] are the vast majority of fishing vessels out there,” Chircop said. “They could easily be taking a load out from beyond the [national] territory at sea.”

Okafor-Yarwood says that the work highlights some of the same things she’s noticed in her research. But she has observed overlap in west African waters between drug trafficking and fishing crimes. “In the Gulf of Guinea, I’ve seen cases where trawlers are used to transport drugs, but they also engage in illegal fishing,” she says. “Absolutely, 100 percent there is overlap.”

She says that fishing vessels involved in trafficking are increasingly being paid in drugs rather than in cash, and they often sell the drugs back to the local coastal communities where they live to turn a profit. “Coastal residents become hopeless prey in the hands of the drug dealers,” she says.

In some regions, drug trafficking can still usher in illegal fishing indirectly, Belhabib says. They also analyzed the data they collected from media and other sources to look for region-specific patterns and trends around the world. The study showed traffickers using fishing vessels to transport drugs in global hotspots such as the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean for cocaine; East Africa for heroin; the sea between Morocco and Spain for marijuana; and the South China Sea for methamphetamines. In the latter case, she says that vessels might occupy themselves with illegal fishing on their return journeys from smuggling operations. In some Mexican marine protected areas, drug trafficking activity is so prevalent that park officials scared of cartel violence won’t even go into the waters, allowing fishing vessels to break the law and fish there with relative impunity. “It threatens conservation efforts,” Belhabib said.

Belhabib notes that the small-time fishers who transport large quantities of drugs likely aren’t seeing much of the profits. Most small fishing boats that turn to drug trafficking do so because fishers have a lack of other options when local fish stocks dry up, she says. The creation of marine protected areas can also be a problem if it’s done in such a way as to leave local fishers out of jobs.

Okafor-Yarwood says that in the Gulf of Guinea, polluted waters are also ruining the fish stocks, which leaves fishers more susceptible to working with drug traffickers. For her, enhancing the livelihood of coastal communities is an important way to buffer against more trafficking.

But better laws, and better enforcement of existing laws, is also key. Many of the countries prone to trafficking are often poor and lack the resources to police their waters. Rashid Sumaila, a professor in oceans and fisheries at the University of British Columbia in Canada who was not involved in Belhabib’s study, says that in the Gulf of Guinea each of the 16 countries that shares the bay manages their own waters. But if the countries banded together to police the waters, they might be able to afford a more effective coast guard.

Sumaila links the lack of policing to the larger problem. He thinks Belhabib’s study is a great addition to the literature on illegal activities at sea. Illegal fishing may not be happening on the same vessels trafficking drugs. But illegal fishing by vessels bearing foreign flags can deplete the stocks of poorer countries less capable of policing their own waters, which indirectly makes those local fishing communities more vulnerable to traffickers and the money they offer. Sumaila and Belhabib both point to the famous case of pirates in Somalia, noting pirates there were former fishermen until foreign fishing vessels illegally depleted local stocks.

“It’s not saying that fishermen are inherent criminals,” says Belhabib, “but some small fishermen have no choices.”",2020-11-13T08:40:43.908Z,2020-11-13T08:40:43.989Z,

Cooperation with allies and partners, such as Mexico, is critical to that effort, said a DOD official.
""Mexico remains the source of nearly all heroin seized in the United States and is a transit route for much of the cocaine available in our country,"" Matthew J. Flynn, deputy assistant secretary of defense for counternarcotics and global threats, said.

Moreover, Mexican cartels take advantage of uneven precursor chemical controls to manufacture deadly drugs, such as fentanyl and methamphetamine, inside of Mexico, which also make their way into the United States, he said.
""Despite the obstacles, Mexican law enforcement and military professionals, in cooperation with their U.S. counterparts, are bravely confronting the transnational criminal organizations that threaten both of our countries,"" Flynn added.

While much more remains to be done in the fight against Mexican cartels, it is important to recognize the efforts of the Mexican security forces that work daily to confront the transnational criminal organizations that threaten both the United States and Mexico, Flynn emphasized.
Two recent seizures highlight the efforts of Mexican agencies to disrupt the cartels' illicit activities, he said. 

On Oct. 15, the Mexican army used radar data from a U.S.-provided radar in Hermosillo, a city in the northwestern Mexican state of Sonora, to track a plane carrying drugs, Flynn said. 
Mexican soldiers moved to the area in which the plane appeared to land and seized a ""poly-load"" totaling 430 kilograms of assorted drugs: 56.6 kilograms of heroin, 4.1 kilograms of fentanyl, 177.2 kilograms of cocaine and 192.6 kilograms of crystal methamphetamine, he said. 

On Oct. 20, the Mexican navy informed U.S. officials of a suspicious vessel off the coast of Colima state, Mexico, Flynn said. The Mexican navy maneuvered six of its vessels to the suspicious vessel, then boarded it and discovered 1.1 metric tons of cocaine.  
A DOD official said that Mexican drug interdictions have been relatively low, and drug cartel violence remains at disturbingly high levels.

This announcement was made by Abdisabir Nur Shurie, Galmudug’s minister for ports and fisheries on his Twitter handle. He noted that the deal was signed in London with Oriental Terminal which is made up of Turkish, British, and Somali companies.

According to the minister, the first survey team would arrive in the country to plan the construction and operation of the port, which he said would bring “significant socio-economic changes in the lives of millions of people in Galmudug and the neighboring states”.

Plans to involve Qatar in the project
The aforementioned deal follows reports in June that the port would be built and operated by a “public-private entity”, with the help of US$ 90M from Somali businesses. The announcement seems to end the initial plans to involve Qatar in the project.

Last year, the government of Qatar was reported to have signed an agreement worth around US$ 170M to build the port, and the project was to have been developed by the state-owned port management company, Mwani Qatar.

Qatar thus aspired to position itself more in relation to its rivals in the Gulf, in this region of the world at the crossroads of several key maritime corridors.

Significance of the proposed port of Hobyo
The future port of Hobyo is of geostrategic interest because of its proximity to the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which is one of the most important sea crossing points in the world, with significant potential for access to international markets. Since the 13th century, Hobyo has been a hub for merchants in textiles, precious metals, and pearls. The main export crops in modern times have been livestock, hides, aromatic woods, and raisins.",2020-11-13T08:42:56.899Z,2020-11-13T08:42:56.945Z,

JHC personnel are also deployed in Mali at Gao Air base, to support 1310 Flight which is currently from C Flight 18 (B) Squadron RAF and their supporting ground crew. One of the JHC units that is supporting the operation is the Tactical Supply Wing (TSW).

The four strong TSW detachment is a key enabling element for the deployment as they carry out the fueling of helicopters and other aircraft as needed. To do this they also have to be able to maintain the equipment and conduct fuels quality assurance testing prior to any refuel to ensure that the fuel is fit for use.  

The detachment is equipped with a very large Oshkosh Tactical Aircraft Refueller tanker that can hold 15,000 liters of fuel. All of the detachment are qualified to operate the Oshkosh pumping compartment or to be on the hose end of refuels, connecting the hose to the aircraft and conducting the refuel.

The fuel that is used is drawn from the main French fuel depot based at the airfield and then the detachment blend in additives that brings the fuel to UK military grade specifications.

Corporal Russ Purcell, the TSW detachment commander said: “It is very satisfying to be able to put all of our training into practice in such a challenging situation and to see that our skills contribute to the successful completion of the various missions we are supporting.”

As the operation has developed the small TSW team’s role has increased.  This means they are now routinely able to refuel the RAF C-17 and Atlas A400M’s that provide the logistical airbridge that sustains the operation. Additionally, however the TSW detachment has increasingly taken the lead in introducing specialist refueling activities for all of the helicopters currently based at Gao, including the Danish Merlins and the French Tiger helicopters as well at the RAF Chinooks.

The program of interoperability training has introduced rotors turning refuels. This means the helicopter is refueled without the engines being shut down and the rotors are still turning. This refueling procedure is a specialist activity that requires additional training and is an activity the UK military refuellers from the RAF and Army Air Corps specialize in.

Following this training the TSW personnel have been using their unique expertise to support UK, Danish and French flying operations both on base and out on the ground. The RAF Chinooks can deploy with additional fuel to allow refueling away from the airbase and so extend the range of operations of French and Danish helicopters.

Lieutenant Colonel Steve Brining, the UK’s National Component Commander and senior officer in Mali said: “The role of JHC has been critical to the success of the UK’s helicopter operations in the African Sahel region. The enablers that are deployed provide the critical mission support that is needed to conduct these operations successfully together with the support we receive from the Joint Helicopter Command Headquarters back in the UK.”",2020-11-13T08:44:56.905Z,2020-11-13T08:44:57.031Z,

The Ayédjoko dam is built on a tributary of the Ouémé River which has its source in the Atakora mountains. The facility will have a storage capacity of 2 million m3. The water will be pumped from the reservoir to supply a drinking water treatment plant with a capacity of 220 m3 per hour, about six times the capacity of another plant (1,200 m3 per hour) which will treat water from the Lifo dam, under construction at Glazoué, in the Collines division in Benin. The Lifo water reservoir, on which work has just begun, will have a storage capacity of 12 million m3.

According to the authorities of this West African country, the water pumped from the dams will be treated and stored in five reservoirs with a capacity of 5,500 m3. It will then be transported via 200 km of pipelines, varying between 75 and 710 mm. The GSC will also set up a remote management system for the future installations.

195,https://www.mining.com/guinea-approves-railroad-and-port-plan-for-simandou/,Guinea approves railroad and port plan for Simandou,"Guinea’s government has approved a multi-national group’s plan to build a railroad and deep-water port to export output from the massive Simandou iron ore deposit to key markets including China, the world’s top consumer of the commodity.

The consortium, which includes Singapore’s Winning Shipping, Guinean mining logistics firm United Mining Supply (UMS), Chinese aluminium producer Shandong Weiqiao and Guinea’s government, won a tender last year to develop blocks 1 and 2 in the northern area of Simandou.

SIGN UP FOR THE IRON ORE DIGEST
Guinea said at the time the consortium had committed to build a 650km railway and a deep-water port and that it aimed to bring the two blocks into production by 2025.

Total cost of the project is now pegged at $16 billion, up from the $14 billion originally estimated.

Allowing miners to ship ore via closer ports in neighbouring Liberia would reduce that cost, but Guinean authorities had repeatedly said they would only allow Simandou exports to leave from a local port.

Battle for riches
At two billion tonnes of iron ore with some of the highest grades in the industry, Simandou is one of the world’s biggest and richest reserves of the steelmaking material, but it has a controversial past.

In 2008, one of Guinea’s former dictators stripped Rio Tinto’s rights over two of the four blocks the deposit had been divided on and handed them to Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz’s BSG Resources (BSGR).

Rio was able keep the two southern blocks, but only after paying $700 million to the government in 2011. That guaranteed the miner tenure for the lifetime of the Simandou mine.

That deal came under scrutiny in 2016, forcing the world’s no. 2 miner to fire two senior managers over a questionable $10.5 million payment made to a consultant who helped the company secure the two blocks and alerted authorities, including the US Department of Justice and the UK’s Serious Fraud Office.

BSGR and Steinmetz were also subject of several investigations over bribery and corruption accusations, but that ended with the deal inked last year.

A London arbitral court later ruled that BSGR had to pay $1.2 billion to Vale, its former partner in Guinea, due to “fraud and breaches of warranty” in inducing the Brazilian miner to enter the joint venture.

The tribunal based its decision partly on the fact that the government revoked the concession in 2014 after finding that BSGR had obtained it by bribing officials.

Chinese presence
The northern blocks became available part of a settlement between Guinea’s government and BSGR last year.

A request which failed to attract his supporters, who say too much blood has been shed.

Many residents in Conakry are worried by the large presence of security forces in the opposition strongholds on the outskirts of the city, including the main Hamdanlaye -Bambeto areas, while others simply refused to go out because they have had enough of the perpetual street protests.

''I decided not to respect the call for a demonstration today, because I am tired of violence, of bloody demonstrations. We have lost several of our friends for no just cause so this time around we are not going to be a sacrificial lamb for politicians,'' said student Alpha Sowe,26.

He told RFI that the opposition needed to change their strategy instead of calling for street demonstrations.

The demonstration was widely ignored by the population especially by the youths many of whom say they felt Guinea's politicians have put them in harm's way too many times.

Results still to come

Conakry remained largely peaceful on Tuesday, but there is tension in the air since presidential elections were held on 18 October.

The national electoral commission declared incumbent President Alpha Condé the winner with nearly 60 percent of the vote, which Diallo's Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea (UDFG) party has contested.

Post electoral violence saw at least 21 people killed.
The Constitutional Court has begun hearing complaints made by five of the twelve presidential candidates on how the election was carried out.

Final results of the elections are expected on Friday, but this remains to be seen as one of the judges is said to have contracted Covid-19.

Businesses affected

Meanwhile, shops remained closed in the opposition strongholds but traffic proceeded as usual under the gaze of security forces.

Shop owners in the area had closed their doors as a preventative measure against attacks during demonstrations.

""I am tired of closing my shop because of demonstrations-- all we want now is for the government to put a stop to meaningless and continuous street demonstrations in the country. I am sitting at home against my will,'' said trader Mohamed Barry, who works in the Cosa area.
Many of the presidential candidates, who are still waiting on the constitutional court for the final results of the elections, said the call for protests on Tuesday was a unilateral decision by Diallo and his UDFG party.

Karim Soumah, head of communications for one of the aggrieved political parties Party of Democrats for Hope (PADES) said they were surprised at the decision.

''We are not part of the demonstration and we will never be part of any movement that would cause prejudice on the people of Guinea. We are waiting on the constitutional court and all what we are asking for is dialogue, not violence,'' said Soumah.

Stop sacrificing youth

Fatoumata Binta Bah, who lost a brother during the recent post-election violence in Conakry, echoed Soumah’s comments, saying that she wanted the opposition leaders to stop using youths for their selfish aims.

''I am calling on political leaders in Guinea to have sympathy on the young population here and not to use them as political tools in their fight,” said Bah.

“I would like both parties to return to the negotiating table instead of using the streets,'' she added.",2020-11-13T08:49:59.267Z,2020-11-13T08:49:59.330Z,

The craft that sank was carrying over 120 people including women and children, it said.

Some 47 survivors have been brought ashore by the Libyan coast guard and fishermen, and 31 bodies have so far been recovered.

The search for the other victims is continuing, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said.

In the past two days at least 19 people, including two children drowned after two boats capsized in the Central Mediterranean, while the vessel Open Arms - the only NGO ship currently operating on this route - rescued more than 200 people in three operations. ""The mounting loss of life in the Mediterranean is a manifestation of the inability of States to take decisive action to redeploy much needed, dedicated Search and Rescue capacity in the deadliest sea-crossing in the world,"" said Federico Soda, IOM Libya Chief of Mission.

""We have long called for a change in the evidently unworkable approach to Libya and the Mediterranean, including ending returns to the country and establishing a clear disembarkation mechanism followed by solidarity from other states. Thousands of vulnerable people continue to pay the price for inaction both at sea and on land."" So far this year, at least 900 people have drowned in the Mediterranean trying to reach European shores, some due to delays in rescue.

More than 11,000 others have been returned to Libya, putting them at risk of facing human rights violations, detention, abuse, trafficking and exploitation, as documented by the United Nations. IOM has recorded a recent upsurge in departures from the country with some 1,900 being intercepted and returned and over 780 arrivals in Italy from Libya since the beginning of October alone. Worsening humanitarian conditions of migrants detained in overcrowded centres, widespread arbitrary arrests and imprisonment, and the extortion and abuse are alarming. In the absence of any safeguards for migrants returned to the country, the Libyan Search and Rescue zone must be redefined to allow for international actors to conduct life-saving operations.

IOM maintains that Libya is not a safe port for return and reiterates its call on the international community and the European Union to take urgent and concrete action to end the cycle of return and exploitation.",2020-11-13T09:00:03.143Z,2020-11-13T09:00:03.203Z,

In its monthly Oil Market Report, the EIA said that permanent shutdowns of refinery capacity had reached 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd). But another more than 20 million bpd crude oil distillation capacity now sits idle, the Paris-based agency said, noting that “there remains significant structural overcapacity.”     

In the past few months alone, refiners have announced more than ten permanent closures of refineries, with the highest capacity planned for closure, 1 million bpd, in the United States, according to the IEA.

“There were capacity shutdowns planned for 2020-2021 prior to COVID-19, but the bulk of the new announcements reflect pessimism about refining economics in a world suffering from temporary demand collapse and structural refining overcapacity,” the agency said in the report, as carried by Reuters.

Refiners in the United States are idling refinery capacity and cutting jobs to cope with the losses stemming from the demand crash in the pandemic.

Refiners are also shutting down permanently or converging oil refineries as the demand crash from the pandemic continues to crush refining margins.

Several refiners and oil majors have recently announced permanent closures in the United States and Asia, while analysts believe that some high-cost refineries in Europe could also be shut down over the next few years as margins for processing crude into fuels are expected to remain depressed.

Shell said this week it would halve the crude oil processing capacity of its largest wholly owned refinery in the world, Pulau Bukom in Singapore, as part of its ambition to be a net-zero emissions business by 2050 or sooner.

Also this week, Petroineos, a joint venture of Ineos and PetroChina, said it plans to permanently close some units at the 210,000-bpd Grangemouth refinery, the only refinery in Scotland, which will cut the facility’s refining capacity to 150,000 bpd.",2020-11-13T09:00:42.199Z,2020-11-13T09:00:42.302Z,

Aqualiner- Swets turned out to be the winner of an EU tendered contract of maximum fifteen years.

Damen will deliver a total of nine vessels, of which six are hybrid and carbon fibre Waterbuses to serve the fast ferry Intercity routes primarily between Sliedrecht, Dordrecht, Rotterdam and the World Heritage site Kinderdijk.

Damen and the new operators have incorporated into the designed to the possibility to convert these vessels to full electric propulsion, by 2030 at the latest. The remaining three vessels, the City Ferries will be fully electric from the start of service in 2022.

Damen has developed the vessels to fulfil the green ambitions of Aqualiner-Swets, the regional minister of transport and all the local governments, including that all ferry services will be completely emissions free by 2030.


All nine of the Waterbuses are therefore extremely efficient in terms of weight, hull design and systems, featuring a hybrid-electric arrangement for peak shaving. Sustainability is an important theme to be found running throughout the overall vessel design. For instance, Damen has developed the vessels’ interiors to be completely circular, using natural materials such as wool and wood, as well as recycled materials.

Together with the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (Marin), Damen performed a parametric study and hull optimisation, to improve the performance on the low wash catamarans. This is aimed at reducing the wake wash produced by the vessels, so as not to cause disruption to those living and working on the water in the area of operation.

“Our work on this project is a good demonstration of Damen’s role, not only as a shipbuilder, but as a provider of comprehensive maritime solutions. What makes it special is our close cooperation with the team of Aqualiner-Swets. Together we have considered every aspect of the operation, looking at vessel types, routes and speeds for maximum fuel efficiency and considering methods to improve the passenger experience,” said Vincent Maes, Damen sales manager Benelux.",2020-11-13T09:01:34.626Z,2020-11-13T09:01:34.669Z,

The joint decision was announced during a visit to Tirana by Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias.

""We have agreed to pass on this case to international justice,"" Dendias said after a meeting with Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama.

Rama said that taking the disagreement to the court in The Hague would ""[join] the dots based on the [court's] expertise and international maritime law.""

Greece has recently launched a push to delimitate its sea borders with neighboring countries, amid high tensions – that threatened to trigger a military confrontation – with eastern neighbor Turkey over offshore energy exploitation rights in the Eastern Mediterranean. Athens has so far signed deals with Italy and Egypt.

Tirana and Athens inked a deal to define their maritime border in 2009, when Albania was governed by the Democratic party that is now in opposition.

But Rama's Socialists, then in opposition, had challenged the agreement in court, claiming it cost the country 225 sq. kilometers (86 sq. miles) of territorial waters.

Albania's Constitutional Court nullified the agreement nine months later, deeming it unconstitutional.

""That issue will not be at our discretion, nor that of the Greek side, but of international justice and in that way we shall focus on our economic [and] regional cooperation,"" Rama said.

Relations between Greece and post-communist Albania have been at times uneasy, largely over minority rights, and Albania's repealing of the 2009 Ionian Sea agreement was another field of tension.

Dendias said Tuesday that Greece would soon nullify the formal state of war still in place between the two countries since World War II, when fascist Italian forces invaded Greece through the Albanian border before being forced to retreat deep into Albania.

European Union member Greece has long backed Albania's desire to eventually join the 27-nation bloc.

The governments in Tirana and Athens have said that the ethnic Greek minority in Albania and the large population in Greece of Albanians who emigrated there after the fall of communism serve as bridges linking the two countries.",2020-11-13T09:02:08.849Z,2020-11-13T09:02:08.916Z,

Sprawling archipelagos and limited government resources make comprehensive maritime domain awareness (MDA) challenging in the Sulu and Celebes Seas. To improve their information gathering capabilities, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines have invested in advanced geospatial data acquisition technologies like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and satellites. Integrating the resulting datasets into existing databases for an aggregate analysis greatly enhances regional MDA. Incorporating geospatial information provides authorities with a deeper understanding of the Sulu and Celebes Seas’ physical environment and how maleficent actors like insurgent groups, human smugglers, and arms traffickers threaten security. These information assets assist law enforcement agencies in prioritizing the deployment of their limited maritime assets and are some of the more critical capabilities in the regional toolkit for ocean governance.

The Sulu and Celebes Seas

The Sulu and Celebes seas are an important geographical area within Southeast Asia. From an international perspective, a significant amount of all commerce traded between Australia and East Asia is shipped through the area. Locally, the seas form a tri-border area heavily used by the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia for littoral trade. The biodiverse marine environment, combined with a significant reliance on fisheries production by littoral countries, also elevates the area’s importance. As pointed out in the Stable Seas: Sulu and Celebes Seas maritime security report, however, the complex political and geographic environment creates substantial difficulties for law enforcement agencies attempting to monitor the Sulu and Celebes Seas for maritime crime. Faced with kidnapping operations of armed militant groups like Abu Sayaff and illegal, unreported, and unregistered fishing violations by both local fishermen and foreign fishing companies, the three littoral countries have begun relying more on advanced geospatial technologies to enhance their maritime domain awareness. The multi-pronged approach to intelligence gathering allows for more informed responses to the wide range of maritime threats present in the region.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles

UAVs offer a flexible and cost-effective method of gathering geospatial data. Flying at an altitude of around 400 feet creates high-resolution orthophotography and aerial mapping. Law enforcement agencies also find the UAVs’ ability to provide real-time information and track moving objects highly useful in dealing with dynamic security environments. The countries in this region began developing early versions of UAVs for maritime intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations in the early 2000s. Indonesia, for instance, began a government-funded program for UAV development in 2004 in order to monitor nontraditional threats like illegal, unregistered, and unreported fishing, as well as trafficking and smuggling.

As technological advances made it easier to access high-quality UAVs, demand rose accordingly. Most recently, the United States Department of Defense provided Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia with a total of 34 Insitu ScanEagle drones to improve their MDA. Their growing popularity is reflected in the global market for UAVs, which Acumen Research and Consulting estimates will achieve a worth of roughly $48.8 billion by 2026. Collecting geospatial data through UAVs has created the opportunity for agencies to expand surveillance coverage of specific areas of interest indicated in intelligence reporting. Increased geospatial surveillance of the Sulu archipelago, for instance, could corroborate reports of Abu Sayyaf insurgent activity on the islands before troops are mobilized for a ground search. 

Satellites 

Satellites provide comprehensive coverage of extensive areas on a consistent basis. Satellites have proven to be an asset through their ability to pierce cloud cover and provide regular region-wide updates across the complex terrain of the Sulu and Celebes Seas. The tropical climate and atmospheric conditions of the tri-border area make satellites all the more useful for regional geospatial data collection.

In September 2018, the Philippines signed an agreement for access to data from the NovaSAR-1 satellite. Equipped with a synthetic-aperture radar (SAR), the NovaSAR-1 can systematically identify vessels and aquaculture systems in Philippine waters. SAR datasets have increasingly been used to identify the location of ships based on their outline, which has proven advantageous in tracking vessels that have turned off their Automatic Identification System transponders. Similarly, Indonesia built its indigenous satellite capabilities through the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN). After collaboratively launching the LAPAN-A1 microsatellite with India, Indonesia created and launched the LAPAN-A2 and LAPAN-A3. The earth observation satellites expand the country’s MDA by incorporating AIS and providing video surveillance. The successful use of microsatellites in Indonesia convinced the government to invest in creating an orbital rocket with the capacity to launch a satellite into low Earth orbit by 2040.

Dataset Integration

Systems designed to integrate geospatial datasets into existing databanks allow experts to conduct a holistic analysis. Overlapping means of ship identification through a combination of AIS and low Earth orbit satellites like SAR provides a system of checks and balances. Merging geospatial data with non-sensor data like human and open-source intelligence means all available information can be comprehensively analyzed for threats. Algorithms tapping into artificial intelligence can then predict imminent illegal or illicit maritime activity by observing real-time data trends.

Algorithm parameters and situational context provided by human experts ensure the analysis is issue-specific and generates actionable results. Within the Sulu and Celebes region, for example, traditional migration patterns between Mindanao in the Philippines and Sabah in Malaysia can confound AI attempts to reliably identify human trafficking and drug smuggling without human guidance.

Conclusion

Innovative means of collecting geospatial datasets allow maritime law enforcement agencies to more comprehensively monitor the maritime domain. When integrated with non-sensor forms of intelligence, geospatial information obtained by UAVs and radar can greatly expand regional coverage. The resulting data analysis conducted through artificial intelligence and system experts then informs governments on illicit and illegal activity. Within the Sulu and Celebes seas, geospatial coverage has reduced the strain placed on limited maritime resources. The bird’s-eye view of open waters, archipelagos, and coastlines means Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines can appropriately allocate law enforcement assets to best counter illicit activity. Given the complex security environment of the Sulu and Celebes seas, the ability to make decisions based on reliable intelligence will significantly impact the success rate of law enforcement operations.

202,https://www.maritimeprofessional.com/news/overcoming-obstacles-maritime-tech-evolution-363098,Overcoming Obstacles to Maritime's Tech Evolution,"The incorporation of information and communications technologies (ICT) is transforming the way the maritime industry is doing business. While the sector is beginning to reap the benefits of integrating smart solutions in its operations, there are barriers that it needs to overcome to ensure that it optimally leverages the adoption of technology.

ICT has disrupted the way many sectors do business, and the maritime industry is no exception as advances in technology are increasingly nullifying traditional ways of working. According to a Global Marine Technology report, technological advances have led to the emergence of new ways of working which is necessitated by the need to optimize operations, explore new opportunities or meet modern day challenges facing the industry. The report further points out that the trends to look out for now and in the future relate to shipbuilding, propulsion and powering, smart shipping, big data and analytics, advanced materials, robotics, sensors and communications.

As broadband connectivity becomes more pervasive, the industry has seen the proliferation of smart shipping and smart ports and the infusion of smart technologies like sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) which has improved operations and safety both at port and at sea. Digital twin technologies have made it simpler and easier to design, build and improve the shipping hull. The advent of 3D printing is also noticeable due to the interest for producing parts that a ship might in an emergency.

The introduction of smart applications such as autonomous ships which use similar technology as driverless cars, is increasingly becoming commonplace in the high seas. While the ships are not expected to be piloted completely by computers, they free up the crew on board to attend to other tasks.

The use of this technology is resulting in fewer accidents and less costly operations. The adoption of virtual reality (VR) applications in training simulations for pilots is proving to be equally valuable, as is the use of drones in conducting ship to shore deliveries. The use of these smart solutions has slashed operational costs as it has negated the need to hire expensive boats to conduct similar tasks. The deployment of this equipment has also played a vital role in security as the drones double up as additional surveillance looking out for stowaways.

In addition, the adoption of these technology solutions has significantly improved operations and made them much safer. The deployment of sensors on ships and yards has resulted in a noticeable improvement in safety at the ports, as this has improved communications between ships, enhancing better communications around issues of ship proximity and speed, thus preventing collisions. Sensors installed in lighthouses also have been crucial in proving warning signals of potential collisions.

The progress that the maritime industry has achieved to integrate technology into its operations is very encouraging, however, there are areas of improvement and a lot more can still be done to fully harness the power of ICT. Collaboration among industry players remains one of the missing links that needs to be plugged. Big maritime players and tech start-ups are not working in concert, but instead seem to be pulling in different directions.

The industry should take a leaf from the financial services sector, which demonstrated how collaboration can benefit both the industry and consumers when established banks teamed up with start-ups who disrupted the industry with innovative, digital services under the Fintech banner. This collaboration resulted in a fruitful partnership that enhanced the value proposition of the industry.

Other areas of improvement include digitizing some aspects of the operations which remain manual and tedious in nature. This can significantly improve efficiencies and result in an immediate returns. For example, electronic bills of landing are mostly physical, and these can be easily digitized through several technologies that are already available in the market. The use of 5G for better, faster and more stable connectivity can be leveraged. The operations and safety of the shipping industry relies on effective communication and 5G can play an invaluable role in this complex risk landscape.

While there is no shortage of smart solutions that can be used to improve operations, the drawback is the shortage of skilled personnel to operate and manage these applications. We believe that the regulatory framework governing the maritime sector should also be amended and make it mandatory for the industry to adopt these technologies, particularly in so far as it relates to safety. Data and analytics have a huge role to play in the maritime industry. When ships travel, they generate tons of data from different sources and in several formats. This inflow of data from the shipping industry is collated and organized in a cloud-based system. Data analytical tools then consolidate, dissect and produce insights from this data which offer endless possibilities.

Data and analytics can positively impact the maritime industry in a number of ways, namely eliminating intuition and promoting better decision making, provide accurate predictive analysis, foster efficient vessel operations, automate operations, boost profits, reduce emissions and improve architectural decisions. For example, data analytics can save time and money by giving vessel operators data on a likely time of engine breakdown, which will give them the opportunity to conduct proactive maintenance before the actual event.

To fully transform the sector, it will also take a combination of identifying solutions, finding people with the necessary skills and experience to implement the smart solutions needed to take the sector to the next level.",2020-11-13T09:09:04.618Z,2020-11-13T09:09:04.751Z,
