      "People will be ordered to stay at home from 0001 GMT on Thursday to combat a surge in new infections that could, if unchecked, cause more deaths than a first wave which forced a three-month lockdown earlier this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 516-38 vote had been in little doubt after the opposition Labour Party said they would support the move, even though they criticised Johnson for acting too slowly. He was also criticised by some in his own party who said a national lockdown was too severe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“None of us came into politics to tell people once again to shutter their shops, to furlough their staff or stay away from their friends and family,” Johnson told parliament in an attempt to calm rebels within his Conservative Party.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United Kingdom, which has the biggest official death toll in Europe from COVID-19, is grappling with more than 20,000 new coronavirus cases a day and scientists have warned the “worst case” scenario of 80,000 dead could be exceeded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those warnings forced Johnson to announce a U-turn on Saturday, having previously insisted on an approach of regional lockdowns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Labour leader Keir Starmer said: “While these regulations are not in any way desirable or perfect, they are now necessary because the government has lost control of the virus.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Dryad Global is reporting that the 10,000 dwt product tanker Nafeli II, operated by the World Carrier Corp. of Greece, was boarded off the coast of Nigeria, approximately 94 nautical miles southwest of the port of Brass. The Panama-flagged tanker built in 2003, operates with a crew of up to 23 people.\n",

      "The vessel activated her SSAS emergency alert system and the crew consisting of Georgian, Russian, and Ukrainian seafarers reportedly retreated to the safe area. The boarders left the vessel and the crew was later reported safe.\n",

      "While the crew was unharmed, Dryad reports that it was the fourteenth such incident in the area this year. The total number of vessels illegally boarded in 2020 in the area of West Africa has now reached 58, which, according to Dryad is tracking slightly above trend when compared to 2019.\n",

      "Dryad is also cautioning that the rate of incidents increases at the end of the monsoon season in the region. They are warning of a historical trend toward a sharp increase in activity during the later part of the year.\n",

      "Reviewing the total number of incidents during the first nine months of the year, a report issued by the ICC International Maritime Bureau (IMB) also highlighted a dramatic increase of activity off West Africa. According to the IMB’s data, there was a 40 percent increase in the number of kidnappings reported in the Gulf of Guinea, compared with the same period in 2019. Pirates armed with guns and knives they warned are abducting bigger groups of seafarers at further distances off the West African coast.\n",

      "November 4, 2020, by Naida Hakirevic\n",
      "\n",
      "The Singapore Registry of Ships (SRS) crossed the 96 million gross tonnage milestone in 2020, maintaining its position among the top five ship registries in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was unveiled during the SRS Forum 2020, a virtual forum organised by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) on 3 November. The theme of this year’s forum was ”Resilience, Strength and Adaptability”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking at the opening address, Quah Ley Hoon, Chief Executive of MPA, said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“While the pandemic has thrown Maritime Singapore many challenges, it also presented us with opportunities to emerge stronger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To do this, MPA will strengthen partnerships to drive digitalisation and decarbonisation of shipping and ensure that the Singapore Registry of Ships is adaptable and agile in the new normal. MPA will also continue supporting our seafarers, the backbone of the maritime industry, through the pandemic.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As explained, the maritime sector including the Port of Singapore has remained resilient even with COVID-19. Singapore’s container throughput registered a 3.7% growth in September this year compared to the same month last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, Singapore’s bunkering volumes were also 5.6% higher from January to September this year, compared to the same period last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Port of Singapore facilitates crew change for more than 50,000 seafarers\n",
      "\n",
      "While fighting the pandemic, MPA has focused on building resilience to support seafarers during the coronavirus.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this pandemic, seafarers face crew change restrictions due to border control measures. Since 27 March 2020, MPA has facilitated crew change in Singapore for more than 50,000 sign-on and sign-off crew of all nationalities from ships of different flags involving more than 2,900 companies and 3,500 ships, through a set of ‘safe corridor’ procedures.\n",
      "\n",
      "The procedures are said to minimise risk to public health for the local community, ships and crew involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Depending on the COVID-19 situation, MPA expects to conduct some 500 to 600 crew changes per day in the coming months,” MPA said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For Singapore-flagged ships, 99% of crew onboard are employed within their service contract period. MPA will continue to work closely with ship operators to repatriate the remaining 1% of crew who are still working onboard on extended contracts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Adoption of technology\n",
      "\n",
      "COVID-19 has also accelerated the adoption of technology at the Port of Singapore.\n",
      "\n",
      "To minimise the risk to crews and surveyors on ships, MPA has been carrying out remote inspections since June this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "To date, MPA’s surveyors have conducted 128 remote Flag State and Port State inspections involving 74 companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "MPA also collaborated with Recognised Organisations to conduct surveys and audits using remote technologies. This includes the inspection of ship equipment via video streaming platforms, and verification of documents sent electronically. Additionally, MPA has carried out close to 250 oral examinations for Certificate of Competency deck and engine candidates through video conferencing since April.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decarbonisation efforts\n",
      "\n",
      "According to MPA, the pandemic has also demonstrated shipping’s importance as a reliable, efficient and cost-effective method of transporting goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Partnering with the industry to drive decarbonisation efforts, MPA said it will extend its memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Global Compact Network Singapore, the local chapter of the United Nations Global Compact, by an additional three years to 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is to promote carbon management and awareness amongst maritime companies. The MoU was first signed in 2017 to provide companies with training on sustainability reporting.\n",
      "\n",
      "MPA also presented Green Ship certificates to 15 companies under the Green Ship Programme (GSP) for reducing the environmental impact of their fleet. Since the GSP’s inception in 2011, 597 Singapore-flagged ships have joined the programme.\n"

The IMO strategy envisages reducing total annual GHG emissions from ships by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008, meaning a reduction in carbon intensity for individual ships and a move to new technologies and low/zero carbon fuels. A number of specific measures are under consideration to achieve the ambitious targets.\n",

      "MINSK, November 2. /TASS/. Police detained some 300 people at unauthorized rallies in Minsk and the Minsk Region on November 1, Belarusian Interior Ministry Spokesperson Olga Chemodanova said on her Telegram channel on Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nearly 300 people were detained for violating the law on mass events in Minsk and in the Minsk Region, and administrative protocols were drawn up against them,\" the spokesperson said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those detained had put up active resistance to police, she noted. In particular, protesters used an improvised explosive device. Police had repeatedly warned that any unlawful steps were unacceptable and took measures to thwart crimes, the spokesperson stressed. The law enforcement officers used stun grenades and rubber bullets.\n",
      "\n",
      "An investigation was launched into active resistance to police and blocking traffic. A total of 13 protests were held across the country. Meanwhile, the spokesperson noted that \"protests in other regions of the republic did not significantly spread and the number of their participants basically did not exceed 10.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nationwide demonstrations have engulfed Belarus following the August 9 presidential election. According to the Central Election Commission’s official results, incumbent President Alexander Lukashenko won by a landslide, garnering 80.10% of the vote. His closest rival in the race, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, came in second, with 10.12% of the ballot. However, she refused to recognize the election’s outcome, and left Belarus for Lithuania. After the results of the exit polls were announced late on August 9, mass protests erupted in downtown Minsk and other Belarusian cities. During the early post-election period, the rallies snowballed into fierce clashes between the protesters and police. The current unrest is being cheered on by the opposition’s Coordination Council, which has been beating the drum for more protests. In response, the Belarusian authorities have castigated the ongoing turmoil and demanded that these unauthorized demonstrations be stopped.\n",

      "Nigeria has ratified the free trade agreement which will now come into effect on Jan 1 2021. It’s a key move for the ambitions of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) given Nigeria’s status not just as one of the continent’s largest economies but also as its most populous country.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes into effect, the AfCFTA aims to create a single market for goods and services in Africa. By 2030, the market size across the continent is expected to include 1.7 billion people with over $6.7 trillion of cumulative consumer and business spending—if all African countries join the agreement. Yet, despite these prospects, and Nigeria’s positive outward stance, the country still poses a major red flag to hopes for free trade across the continent.\n",
      "\n",
      "For over a year, Nigeria’s land borders with Benin, Niger, and Cameroon have been closed as the government aimed to stop the smuggling of food items which it says undermines local agricultural businesses. It’s a protectionist move that’s in line with previous policies under the current Buhari administration despite little evidence of efficacy.\n",

      "For instance, despite a hike in rice tariffs aimed at boosting local production, a lack of capacity to meet local consumption levels mean market gaps are still being plugged by illegal rice imports.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest impact is felt by informal traders—most of them small and medium enterprises that operate along the Nigeria-Benin border. Nigeria’s high level of protection on products like rice has made smuggling from neighboring countries very lucrative. The World Bank has estimated 80% of imports into Benin are destined for Nigeria.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nigeria’s ratification of the AfCFTA is a welcome development, but the country’s commitment to intra-African trade should also be materialized in reality by the re-opening of its land borders,” says Landry Signé, a Brookings Institution senior fellow. “Re-opening the borders will send a strong signal about Nigeria’s intentions...to boost intra-African trade.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Cause and effect\n",
      "\n",
      "While the border closure was imagined as crackdown on a food imports, it translated into blockade on all imports and exports as well. The move has had far-reaching, cross-border implications from paralyzing supply chains to impacting import and export-based businesses. Kobo360, a logistics startup that matches businesses with freight trucks for cross-country haulage, says, in recent statement, that demand fell by nearly 30% within the first months of border closure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regular Nigerians are also paying a big price for the policy as food inflation has reached a 31-month high last month. Despite the Nigerian government’s best intentions, the country still remains far from being self-sufficient as local food consumption far outstrips production. SBM Intel, a Lagos-based market intelligence firm, predicts the spike in food prices “will worsen in the coming months if the borders remain closed,” especially ahead of the busy festive season.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it turns out, Dangote Cement and BUA Group—two of Nigeria’s largest businesses—have recently been granted exemptions to the border closure and will now be allowed to resume exports. But the exemptions have resulted in public criticism and accusations of favoritism, especially given Dangote’s long-running close links with successive Nigerian governments.\n",
      "\n",
      "For his part however, Obi Ozor, Kobo360 CEO is hoping the exemptions ultimately result in “broader and seamless re-opening of the borders.”\n",

      "Andrew Bailey spoke about twin threats to growth from renewed coronavirus lockdowns and Brexit disruption after the latest meeting of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) that saw it unleash more quantitative easing (QE).\n",
      "\n",
      "Interest rates were held at their record low of 0.1% - defying speculation among some commentators that it could opt for negative rates for the first time in its history to encourage more lending by banks and spending.\n",

      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Bailey said of the damage: \"Now we think there'll be a further downturn in the fourth quarter...so I think it's quite likely that the economy will end this year probably around 10 or 11% below where it was in terms of activity in the last year and that is historically unprecedented.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The fresh QE also reflected, what the Bank called, an \"initial period of adjustment\" to be expected following the conclusion of the Brexit transition period, saying its influence was based on the assumption of a trade deal being agreed by the year's end.\n",

      "Romania's announcement that the country would ban Chinese tech giant Huawei from its networks was the latest move to roll back China's dominance in cutting-edge 5G telecommunication in Central and Southeastern Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The announcement by Prime Minister Ludovic Orban on November 1 comes as the United States seriously steps up its \"China strategy\" in Europe recently, inking a slew of declarations across the region designed to limit China’s role in telecom networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "It comes shortly after the October announcements by the U.S. State Department that it had signed deals with Slovakia, North Macedonia, Kosovo, and Bulgaria on high-speed wireless network technology, joining what the U.S. administration of President Donald Trump has dubbed the Clean Network program, unveiled in August to \"counter long-term threats to data privacy, security, and human rights posed to the free world from authoritarian malign actors, such as the Chinese Communist Party.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The U.S. is achieving its goals in terms of limiting Huawei in Europe’s networks,\" Ivana Karaskova, the founder of China Observers in Central and Eastern Europe (CHOICE) and a China research fellow at the Association for International Affairs in Prague, told RFE/RL. “These agreements are part of a much tougher approach toward China from governments in [the region].”\n",
      "\n",
      "The agreements mark a last-minute series of diplomatic wins for the United States’ wider push to counter China’s growing global influence and are a sign that disenchantment with Beijing is spreading in Central and Southeastern Europe, an area previously viewed as conciliatory towards China.\n",
      "\n",
      "U.S. government officials have led a campaign across Europe and elsewhere against the inclusion of Huawei, which has been blacklisted in the United States for posing a threat to national security and using its technology to spy on behalf of the Chinese government.\n",
      "\n",
      "China denies the charge and argues that the U.S. initiative is driven mainly by commercial concerns. Both the Chinese government and Huawei representatives have repeatedly dismissed claims that Chinese-built infrastructure is a security risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bilateral agreements signed by the Central Europeans and Washington make no specific mention of other countries and do not explicitly ban specific companies from the networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the memorandums are widely seen to take aim at Chinese telecoms giants like Huawei and ZTE that are building up 5G infrastructure all over the world, having also made significant headway in recent years across Central and Southeastern Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This shift isn’t simply about U.S. diplomatic pressure,” Karaskova said, “it is also the result of growing domestic concerns in Europe towards China.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Anatomy Of A Shift\n",
      "\n",
      "The new additions to the Clean Network program are part of a harder line taken towards China across Europe, with 5G networks becoming a central front.\n",
      "\n",
      "In October, Sweden moved to ban Huawei and ZTE from its 5G infrastructure, joining the United Kingdom, which announced similar measures in July.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other major European powers such as Germany, France, and Italy have taken aim at those Chinese tech firms. While stopping short of outright bans, they have instead moved to restrict Huawei from participation in their networks by creating legal barriers and limiting how domestic industries can cooperate with the Chinese companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elsewhere, multiple Central and East European countries -- including Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Slovenia -- have all agreed to work with the United States on 5G cybersecurity, signalling future plans to restrict or phase out Huawei and ZTE.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The debate on 5G within Europe has shifted quickly, in part because of a change in U.S. diplomatic approach,” Erik Brattberg, the director of the Europe program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told RFE/RL.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is a recognition that simply pushing countries to outright ban Huawei is not always productive,\" he said. \"Now they are allowing countries to cite their own security concerns and make their own decisions to achieve the same result.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The headway made to limit China’s presence in Europe’s 5G networks is particularly notable in Central and Southeastern Europe. In 2012, 16 countries formed an economic cooperation forum with Beijing called 16+1, which was expanded into 17+1 in 2019 with the addition of Greece.\n",
      "\n",
      "The initiative was quickly co-opted into China’s far-reaching Belt and Road Initiative, which launched in 2013, with Beijing viewing the region as cheap access to European markets and a geopolitical foothold within the continent.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the forum has lost momentum recently as European members have grown disillusioned with Beijing as grand infrastructure building plans for the region have not developed as expected and much-desired investment from China has lagged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Growing concerns over Beijing's so-called “mask diplomacy” throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and aggressive “wolf warrior” tactics by its diplomats across Europe have also hardened attitudes and raised security concerns about China.\n",
      "\n",
      "Growing geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington have also prompted many countries in the region to reevaluate their China strategies, particularly as the United States has escalated its focus on China’s foothold in 5G technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The 21st century is becoming a century of rivalry between Washington and Beijing -- and increasingly there is less room for gray areas,” Vuk Vuksanovic, a researcher at the London School of Economics and Political Science and a former Serbian diplomat, told RFE/RL. “I think we are seeing a slow drift where many countries are seeing that their ties to the United States are more important than their cooperation with Beijing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Navigating A Rivalry\n",
      "\n",
      "Against the backdrop of the pandemic, the European Union has taken a tougher approach toward China, labeling the country a rival and sparring with Beijing over issues such as human rights violations in Hong Kong and China's western Xinjiang Province.\n",
      "\n",
      "But despite the more strained relationship, economic relations between Brussels and Beijing are still crucial, with the EU becoming China’s largest trading partner and China becoming the EU’s second-largest after the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "While many Central and Southeastern European countries have moved to restrict Chinese firms in their 5G networks, they are still looking to preserve ties with Beijing in other realms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving forward, many European countries will be hoping for a more coordinated China policy with Washington that can allow them to pursue shared strategic goals without having to alienate Beijing as a partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has countries across the continent closely watching the November 3 presidential election in the United States, where both candidates have proposed different styles, but similar views, in terms of their China policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Trump administration has pushed a hard line against Beijing, but has followed a unilateral approach that has left the EU on the outside looking in and, at times, caught in the cross fire of U.S. policy moves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tension between the United States and Europe over issues ranging from trade and Iran to defense spending have also strained ties between Washington and Brussels in recent years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Former Vice President Joe Biden has also called for tough China policies, signalling to Europe that Washington’s more confrontational approach to Beijing is here to stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Most European countries understand that there is a growing bipartisan consensus in Washington to view China as an adversary and that would continue under [either] a Biden or Trump administration,” Carnegie's Brattberg said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Biden foreign-policy advisers have differed by calling for a consultative approach with Europe, saying that they would consult allies on any future U.S. tariffs on China and will adopt a more multilateral style that will balance concerns over how best to confront Beijing in Europe and around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What Europeans want is a United States counterpart that shares the EU view that China is a rival that needs to be checked but still can be a partner on some important global issues,” Brattberg said.\n"

      "Anyone who has ever landed at Berlin's Tegel airport is not likely to forget the unique experience. For those who have never been to Tegel, the fuss being made about its replacement and closure on November 8 may be hard to understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for many Tegel — TXL in airport language — is much more than just an airport. It is a piece of history filled with emotions. Its story is one of struggle, perseverance and in the end one of success that was too much for it to handle.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was built, Tegel connected West Berlin to the outside world. At the time, West Berlin was like an island, surrounded by an imposing wall and barbed wire built by Communist East Germany. There were a number of \"transit\" roads and train connections that could be used to access the Western enclave. But they all went through Soviet-occupied East German territory. The only way to get around this — and East German authorities — was flying in or out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The original Terminal A building (see below) is so special because of its shape. Its six sides form a big hexagon. The center of the building is a large open courtyard for traffic and is used for pickups and drop-offs in front of each individual gate. This makes the distance from curb to plane remarkably short. From a car parked outside to the gate it was only a 28-meter (90-feet) walk. For good reason, Tegel was soon called a drive-in airport.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Cold War lifeline\n",
      "\n",
      "The area where the airport now stands has been used for aviation for over a century. At the beginning of the 20th century, airships were based there. During the two World Wars it was a military training area. After World War II, Berlin was famously divided into two, East and West.\n",
      "\n",
      "West Berlin was divided further among the British, Americans and French. When the Russians started the Berlin Blockade in 1948, West Berlin's existing Tempelhof airport was not enough to handle the airlift's needs. Additionally, passenger flights to and from the city were highly subsidized by the West German government. The cheap flights pushed up passenger numbers and soon Tempelhof was bursting at the seams.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tegel airport during construction in 1972\n",
      "\n",
      "With all that in mind, the French authorities started building a runway and provisional infrastructure in Tegel, part of Berlin's French sector. Amazingly, 85 days later the first planes were landing on the longest runway in Europe with supplies to keep the city alive. Afterward it was used by the military, but in 1960 it was given over to civilian use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Provisional buildings were built and Air France started commercial flights. Others followed. Then in 1961 the Berlin Wall was put up making Berlin's isolation complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "A truly one-of-a-kind airport\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea for the Tegel airport that we know today came from the architect Meinhard von Gerkan. Now 85-years-old, one of his first jobs was to design the new airport. With little experience he and his partners started planning in 1965. Construction began in 1970 and it opened on November 1, 1974. A year later Tegel had overtaken Tempelhof as the West Berlin airport. Today it is the size of nearly 650 soccer fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides being so close to the city center, the airport is unusual for other reasons. Each gate has its own check-in, security, customs desk and luggage carousel. There is no need to be ushered through a duty-free shop to get to the waiting lounge. Tegel is only about flying — not shopping, entertainment or eating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once inside the main terminal, passengers can walk a complete circle and get back to their original gate without going outside. It has 14 jet bridges that serve 16 check-in counters. The building's curves, angles, cantilevered staircases and use of concrete, glass and metal make it look a bit like a futuristic spaceship. The use of colorful signage evokes a different era.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later additions were built starting in the 2000s, but they were only meant to be temporary solutions. Technically the airport now boasts five terminals, but one is basically a long hallway that was once a parking garage, another is a big faceless metal-clad hanger. Both are connected by covered outdoor walkways, not fancy trams or underground moving sidewalk.\n",

      "It isn't just the airport architecture that made aviation a singular experience in Berlin. During the division of the city, all air traffic to West Berlin was under Allied occupied control and only airlines registered in those countries could fly in or out, even the crew needed a French, British or American passport.\n",
      "\n",
      "German airline Lufthansa was locked out leaving room for Air France, British Airways and Pan Am. After unification, other airlines were allowed to use West Berlin's airports. Lufthansa bought most of Pan Am's traffic rights and its slots at Tegel. As Berlin became a popular tourist destination the city's airports saw huge increases in traffic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the years presidents, queens, popes, stars and even the Concorde landed in Tegel\n",
      "\n",
      "At Tegel that meant crowding. Soon many passengers had to board a bus to be taken to the planes for boarding or deplaning because there weren't enough gates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite this growth Tegel never made it to the top-rank airports in Europe. Frankfurt, Munich and Düsseldorf had grown into major hubs while Tegel was mainly used to get passengers to such hubs for onward journeys. This is just as well since Tegel doesn't have a transit zone and passengers had to go through security again if they were changing planes.\n",
      "\n",
      "A long aviation history comes to an end\n",
      "\n",
      "Located near the city center and officially called Otto Lilienthal Airport in honor of a German aviation pioneer known for using gliders, today Tegel is the country's fourth-busiest airport. Last year it saw an all-time high of over 24 million passengers serviced by 65 different airlines. Well up from 2000's 10 million passengers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unsurprisingly the impact of coronavirus lockdowns have decimated passenger numbers and Tegel will fade away without a big bang when it is replaced by the much delayed Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER) on the outskirts of the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tegel's original main Terminal A in busier days\n",
      "\n",
      "BER was dreamed up to take on the increased traffic, but part of the deal meant that both other Berlin airports would close. Construction began in 2006 and was set to end in 2011. Tegel was set to close right afterwards. That didn't happen as BER was delayed time and again. A referendum to keep Tegel open had strong public support, but the government said it was impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the last flight to leave Tegel on November 8 will be an Air France jet to Paris. After that the terminal buildings and the surrounding land are supposed to be turned into an industrial research park. So far plans are sketchy, but that is nothing new for Berlin.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is sure is that architect Meinhard von Gerkan and his firm drew up the plans for BER airport to replace his own Tegel magnum opus. Ironically things have come full circle, or rather full hexagon.\n"

      "Development firm Scape North America closed this week on a $165 million construction loan and plans to start work by the end of November on its 451-unit building on Boylston Street, near Fenway Park. It’s the first large apartment building anywhere in Boston to launch work since the pandemic hit in March.\n",
      "\n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic is clobbering apartment rents, especially in student-heavy neighborhoods in and around Boston.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $230 million project has been in the works for several years, and is the first of three apartment buildings the developer — which launched here planning student housing but shifted to build more general-purpose apartments — has planned in the Fenway. It won city approvals in January. Scape’s ability to find a lender at a time when financing for apartment buildings has grown scarce speaks to the strength of the neighborhood and Boston’s life science industry, said CEO Andrew Flynn.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It really represents a testament from capital markets in their confidence in the expanding medical hub of Longwood, and the rapidly expanding life science industry in the Fenway,” Flynn said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "The project is being financed by Madison Realty Capital, a New York-based investment firm that’s also funding the Raffles Back Bay Hotel & Residences now under construction off Stuart Street. The private-equity-backed firm has made several large construction loans in recent months. Madison said it likes this project’s proximity to job centers such as Longwood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, rents have fallen sharply in Boston as the pandemic has dampened demand from both students and young professionals. The median apartment rent has plunged 16 percent compared with November 2019, according to real estate website ApartmentList, and thousands more units remain under construction around the city, set to open over the next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Breaking ground now, the Scape project would be further out in the pipeline; Flynn projects an opening in late 2022. He and his investors — which include Madison as well as Boston-based equity partners — are betting that’s far enough in the future that demand will recover, particularly in a place like the Fenway where a wave of new commercial development aimed at life science companies is likely to draw workers who’ll need someplace to live.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boston has experienced significant growth in the areas of life sciences, health care, and technology, and this financing will ensure that workers in these sectors will have access to much-needed, reasonably priced housing options in the highly sought-after Fenway neighborhood,” said Madison managing principal Josh Zegen. “We look forward to working ... on an important project in the Boston area.”\n",

      "On Thursday morning, a disorganized Eta continued to produce heavy rain and life-threatening flash flooding over portions of Central America. It had winds of 30mph, was located over Honduras and was moving west-northwest at 8 mph.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Central America, through the weekend heavy rainfall from Eta is expected to lead to continued catastrophic, life-threatening flash flooding along with landslides in areas of higher terrain. Flooding is also possible across Jamaica, southeast Mexico, the Cayman Islands and western Cuba. Storm totals could be between 30-40 inches by the time the rain ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eta is forecast to regain tropical storm strength over the northwest Caribbean Sea on Friday. Although the details of the future track and intensity of Eta are uncertain, Cuba, South Florida and the Florida Keys should start preparing for impacts from wind and rainfall beginning late this weekend and lasting into early next week. The forecast has slowed down compared to Wednesday, so timing of greatest potential effects for the Florida Keys and South Florida is likely Monday and Tuesday at this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of intensity, an extended period of heavy rain and gusty winds is possible for southern Florida. Several inches of rain, possibly up to 10 inches, is possible. This area is already saturated, which could compound the flood risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "With more than 75 inches of rain so far this year, Miami is currently having its seventh wettest year on record. Other locations currently experiencing a top 10 wettest year include Fort Lauderdale, Fort Pierce and Vero Beach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Download the NBC News app for breaking news\n",
      "\n",
      "If Eta's center of circulation remains intact over Central America, it will keep the name. If it loses its center of circulation and a new circulation forms over the northwest Caribbean, there is a chance it would get a new name in which case would be Theta.\n",
      "\n",
      "Important to note, whatever the tropical system is named when it approaches Florida, the effects will be the same, and folks in the current path should prepare for a prolonged wet and windy period on the horizon.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2020, there's been a record-breaking 11 landfalls on the U.S. mainland. Remarkably, none of those have been in the state of Florida.\n"
