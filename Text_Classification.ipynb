I would say that among those 72, around 5 or 6 are not really useful links (\"About Us\", \"Sky News For Your Phone\"...), but this is because our model is not really optimal, we don't have a lot of training data (only 537 {headline, link} pairs). We need to add more rows to the training set (not really difficult to do, just a bit time consuming), and improve the classification on the text in the headlines."
